## Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

## Our opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of HSBC Bank Middle East Limited (the 'company') and its subsidiaries (together the 'group') as at 31 December 2024, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') and as adopted by the United Kingdom ('UK').

## What we have audited

The group's consolidated financial statements comprise:

- -the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2024;
- -the consolidated income statement for the year then ended;
- -the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
- -the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended;
- -the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
- -the notes to the consolidated financial statements, comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information on pages 12 to 71.

## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing ('ISAs'). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Independence

We are independent of the group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) and the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Dubai Financial Services Authority ('DFSA'). We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.

## The scope of our audit

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

## How we tailored our group audit scope

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry and the geographical locations in which the group operates.

The risks that the group faces are diverse, with the interdependencies between them being numerous and complex. In performing our risk assessment we engaged with a number of stakeholders to ensure we appropriately understood and considered these risks and their interrelationships. This included external factors across the geopolitical, macroeconomic, regulatory and the accounting landscape as well as the internal environment at the group, driven by strategy and transformation.

## Our Audit approach (continued)

## How we tailored our group audit scope (continued)

Through our risk assessment, we tailored our scoping approach as to which entities and balances we needed to perform testing over to support our group opinion, taking into consideration the complex and disaggregated group structure, the accounting processes and controls as well as the industry in which the group operates. The risks of material misstatement can be reduced to an acceptable level by testing the most financially significant locations within the group and those that drive particular significant risks identified as part of our risk assessment. This ensures that sufficient coverage has been obtained for each financial statement line item ('FSLI'). We continually assessed risks and changed the scope of our audit where necessary.

A significant amount of the group's operational processes which are critical to financial reporting, such as expected credit losses, are undertaken in operations centres. The audit work over the operations centres' processes and controls was performed by PwC member firms in each of the global operations centre locations, oversight from us. This work enabled us to evaluate the effectiveness of the controls over key processes that supported material balances, classes of transactions and disclosures within the group consolidated financial statements, and to consider the implications on our audit work. In aggregate, the audit work performed across the locations provided us with the audit evidence required to form an opinion on the group consolidated financial statements.

## Materiality

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

| Overall materiality                             | US$55.7 million.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| How we determined it                            | 5% of profit before tax.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied | We used profit before tax as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the  benchmark against which the performance of the group is most commonly  measured by users and is a generally accepted benchmark. |

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to US$42 million.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that 75%, which is at the upper end of our normal range, was appropriate.

We agreed with those charged with governance that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above US$3 million as well as misstatements that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

## Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

## Our Audit approach (continued)

## Key audit matters (continued)

## Key audit matter

## Expected credit losses - Impairment on loans and advances to customers

We focused on the Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') for loans and advances to customers due to the materiality of the loan balances and the associated allowances for ECL. In addition, the compliance with IFRS in this area involves management judgement and is subject to a high degree of estimation uncertainty.

As disclosed in note 31, the allowance for ECL for loans and advances to customers as at 31 December 2024, is US$56.2 million. The largest loan portfolios and significant ECL allowances are in the UAE and Qatar.

Management makes various assumptions when estimating ECL. The significant assumptions that we focused on in our audit included those with greater levels of management judgement which had the most significant impact on ECL. These included assumptions made in:

- -the application and determination of forward looking economic scenarios and their probability weights;
- -estimating material management judgmental adjustments; and
- -estimating expected cash flows for credit impaired wholesale exposures.

The level of estimation uncertainty and judgement has remained high during 2024 as a result of the uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and a change in global interest rate environment. Economic conditions vary between territories and industries, leading to uncertainties around judgements made in determining the severity and probability weighting of macroeconomic variable forecasts across the different economic scenarios used in ECL models.

The modelling methodologies used to estimate ECL are developed using historical experience. The impact of the prevailing economic conditions has resulted in certain inherent limitations in the use of these methodologies to forecast the extent and timing of expected customer defaults and therefore on estimation of ECL. In addition, modelling methodologies do not incorporate all factors that are relevant to estimating ECL, such as differing impact of economic conditions on industry sectors.

These limitations are addressed with management adjustments, the measurement of which is inherently judgmental and subject to a high level of estimation uncertainty.

Management makes other assumptions which are less judgmental or for which variations have a less significant impact on ECL. These assumptions include:

- -quantitative scorecards used in determining customer risk ratings ('CRRs'); and
- -quantitative and qualitative criteria used to assess significant increases in credit risk.

## Other information

The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Report of the Directors and Additional information on pages 72 - 81 (but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon).

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

We assessed the design and operating effectiveness of governance and controls over the estimation of ECL.

We observed management's review and challenge at governance forums where we observed assessment of ECL for Retail and Wholesale portfolios, including the assessment of model limitations and any resulting management judgmental adjustments.

We also tested controls over:

- -Credit reviews that determine customer risk ratings for wholesale customers;
- -the identification of credit impairment triggers;
- -the input of critical data into source systems, and the flow and
- transformation of critical data from source systems to the impairment calculation engine;
- -the calculation and approval of management judgmental adjustments to modelled outcomes; and
- -approval of significant individual impairments.

We involved our modelling experts in assessing the appropriateness of modelling methodologies that were enhanced during the year. We also assessed the appropriateness of modelling methodologies that did not change during the year and whether post model adjustments were needed.

- In addition, we performed substantive testing over:
- -appropriateness and application of the quantitative and qualitative criteria used to assess significant increase in credit risk;
- -a sample of critical data used in the year-end ECL calculation and management judgmental adjustments;
- -a sample of credit reviews to determine that Credit Risk Ratings were appropriately applied to wholesale exposures.

We obtained reporting from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ('PwC UK') containing the results of certain centralised audit procedures in respect of ECL. We reviewed the reporting received in the context of the appropriateness of the nature, timing and extent of the work performed for the purpose of our audit. Their work included:

- -the compliance of ECL methodologies and assumptions with the requirements of IFRS 9;
- -testing of model validation and monitoring controls;
- -observing the review and challenge at governance forum's discussions around the determination of macroeconomic variable ('MEV') forecasts and their likelihood for different economic scenarios;
- -testing of the calculation and approval of management judgmental adjustments to modelled outcomes; and
- -assessment of the significant assumptions made in determining the severity and probability weighting of MEV forecasts using the PwC UK member firm's economic experts.

We performed an independent credit assessment for a sample of wholesale exposures, including stage 3, by assessing quantitative and qualitative factors, including an assessment of the financial performance of the borrower, the source of repayments and its history and credit risk mitigation, including collateral, on a discounted cash flow basis. We assessed the disclosures included in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements and assessed their compliance with the requirements of applicable IFRS Accounting Standards.

## Responsibilities of Directors and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements

The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the United Kingdom ('UK') and their preparation in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements of the DFSA, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.

## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- -identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- -obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal control.
- -evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.
- -conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- -evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- -Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for the purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation provides public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Report on legal and other regulatory requirements

As required by the applicable provisions of the DFSA Rulebook, we report that the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements of the DFSA.

## Notes on the financial statements

## 1 Legal status and principal activities

The bank has its place of incorporation in Dubai International Financial Centre ('DIFC'), in the United Arab Emirates, under a category 1 licence issued by the Dubai Financial Services Authority ('DFSA').

The bank's head office and registered office is Level 4, Gate Precinct Building No. 2, Dubai International Financial Centre, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The group through its branch network and subsidiary undertakings provides a range of banking and related financial services in the Middle East and North Africa.

The immediate parent company of the group is HSBC Middle East Holdings B.V. and the ultimate parent company of the group is HSBC Holdings plc, which is incorporated in England.

## 2 Basis of preparation and material accounting policies

## 2.1 Basis of preparation

## (a) Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards

The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') ('IFRS Accounting Standards'), including interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee. These financial statements are also compliant with IFRS Accounting Standards adopted by the United Kingdom ('UK') as there are no applicable differences from IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB for the periods presented. At 31 December 2024, there were no unendorsed standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2024 affecting these consolidated financial statements.

## Standards adopted during the year ended 31 December 2024

There were no new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations that had a significant effect on the group in 2024. Accounting policies have been applied consistently.

## (b) Future accounting developments

## Minor amendments to IFRSs

The IASB has published a number of minor amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards that are effective from 1 January 2025. Management expects they will have an insignificant effect, when adopted, on the consolidated financial statements of the group.

## Other amendments and new IFRS Accounting Standards

Amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'

In May 2024, the IASB issued amendments to 'IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures', effective for annual reporting periods beginning on, or after, 1 January 2026. In addition to guidance as to when certain financial liabilities can be deemed settled when using an electronic payment system, the amendments also provide further clarification regarding the classification of financial assets that contain contractual terms that change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows, including those arising from ESG-related contingencies, and financial assets with certain non-recourse features. The group is undertaking an assessment of the potential impact.

## IFRS 18 'Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements'

In April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18 'Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements', effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027. The new accounting standard aims to give users of financial statements more transparent and comparable information about an entity's financial performance. It will replace IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' but carries over many requirements from that IFRS Accounting Standard unchanged. In addition, there are three sets of new requirements relating to the structure of the income statement, management-defined performance measures and the aggregation and disaggregation of financial information.

While IFRS 18 will not change recognition criteria or measurement bases, it may have an impact on presenting information in the financial statements, in particular the income statement and to a lesser extent in the cash flow statement. The group is currently assessing impacts and data readiness before developing a more detailed implementation plan.

## (c) Going concern

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors are satisfied that the group has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Directors have considered a range of information relating to present and future conditions, including future projections of profitability, cash flows, capital requirements, capital resources and the impact of stressed scenarios on the group's operations.

## (d) Foreign currencies

The group's consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form the major currency bloc in which the group transacts and funds its business. The US dollar is also HSBC Bank Middle East Limited's functional currency because the US dollar and currencies linked to it are the most significant currencies relevant to the underlying transactions, events and conditions, as well as representing a significant proportion of its funds generated from financing activities.

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, except non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost, which are translated using the rate of exchange at the initial transaction date. Exchange differences are included in other comprehensive income or in the income statement depending on where the gain or loss on the underlying item is recognised. In the

consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose functional currency is not US dollars are translated into the group's presentation currency at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, while their results are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement.

## (e) Critical estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and judgements about future conditions. In view of the inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity involved in the recognition or measurement of items highlighted as the critical estimates and judgements in section 2.2 below, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ from those on which management's estimates are based. This could result in materially different estimates and judgements from those reached by management for the purposes of these financial statements. Management's selection of the group's accounting policies which contain critical estimates and judgements reflects the materiality of the items to which the policies are applied and the high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty involved.

## (f) Segmental analysis

The group's chief operating decision-maker is the Board. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Board.

Measurement of segmental assets, liabilities, income and expenses is in accordance with the group's accounting policies. Segmental income and expenses include transfers between segments, and these transfers are conducted at arm's length. Shared costs are included in segments on the basis of the actual recharges made.

These will replace our previously reported operating segments up to 31 December 2024.

## (g) Composition of the group

The bank established a new wholesale banking branch in Oman during the first half of 2024. There were no other material changes in the composition of the group.

## 2.2 Summary of material accounting policies

## (a) Consolidation and related policies

## Investments in subsidiaries

Where an entity is governed by voting rights, the group consolidates when it holds directly or indirectly - the necessary voting rights to pass resolutions by the governing body. In all other cases, the assessment of control is more complex and requires judgement of other factors, including having exposure to variability of returns, power to direct relevant activities, and whether power is held as agent or principal.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The amount of non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. This selection is made for each business combination.

Impairment testing is performed where there is an indication of impairment, by comparing the recoverable amount of the relevant investment to its carrying amount.

## Interests in associates and joint arrangements

Joint arrangements are investments in which the group, together with one or more parties, has joint control. Depending on the group's rights and obligations, the joint arrangement is classified as either a joint operation or a joint venture. The group classifies investments in entities over which it has significant influence, and those that are neither subsidiaries nor joint arrangements, as associates.

The group recognises its share of the assets, liabilities and results in a joint operation. Investments in associates are recognised using the equity method. The attributable share of the results and reserves of associates is included in the consolidated financial statements of group based on either financial statements made up to 31 December or pro-rated amounts adjusted for any material transactions or events occurring between the date the financial statements are available and 31 December. Investments in associates are assessed at each reporting date and tested for impairment when there is an indication that the investment may be impaired.

## (b) Income and expenses

## Operating income

## Interest income and expense

Interest income and expense for all financial instruments, excluding those classified as held for trading or designated at fair value, are recognised in 'Interest income' and 'Interest expense' in the income statement using the effective interest method. However, as an exception to this, interest on debt instruments issued by the group for funding purposes that are designated under the fair value option to reduce an accounting mismatch and on derivatives managed in conjunction with those debt instruments is included in interest expense.

Interest on credit-impaired financial assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost (i.e. gross carrying amount of the asset less allowance for ECL).

## Non-interest income and expense

The group generates fee income from services provided at a fixed price over time, such as account service and card fees, or when the group delivers a specific transaction at the point in time such as broking services and import/export services. With the exception of certain fund management and performance fees, all other fees are generated at a fixed price. Fund management and performance fees can be variable depending on the size of the customer portfolio and the group's performance as fund manager. Variable fees are recognised when all uncertainties are resolved. Fee income is generally earned from short-term contracts with payment terms that do not include a significant financing component.

The group acts as principal in the majority of contracts with customers, with the exception of broking services. For most brokerage trades the group acts as agent in the transaction and recognises broking income net of fees payable to other parties in the arrangement.

The group recognises fees earned on transaction-based arrangements at a point in time when the group has fully provided the service to the customer. Where the contract requires services to be provided over time, income is recognised on a systematic basis over the life of the agreement.

Where the group offers a package of services that contains multiple non-distinct performance obligations, such as those included in account service packages, the promised services are treated as a single performance obligation. If a package of services contains distinct performance obligations, the corresponding transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated stand-alone selling prices.

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. This is the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and usually the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities.

Net income/(expense) from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss includes the following:

- - 'Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis': This comprises net trading activities, which includes all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading and other financial instruments managed on a fair value basis, together with the related interest income, interest expense and dividend income, excluding the effect of changes in the credit risk of liabilities managed on a fair value basis. It also includes all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are managed in conjunction with financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.
- - 'Changes in fair value of designated debt instruments and related derivatives': Interest expense on debt instruments and interest cash flows on related derivatives is presented in interest expense where doing so reduces an accounting mismatch.
- - 'Changes in fair value of other financial instruments mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss': This includes interest on instruments which fail the solely payments of principal and interest ('SPPI') test.

## (c) Valuation of financial instruments

All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is generally its transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received). However, if there is a difference between the transaction price and the fair value of financial instruments whose fair value is based on a quoted price in an active market or a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the group recognises the difference as a trading gain or loss at inception (a 'day 1 gain or loss'). In all other cases, the entire day 1 gain or loss is deferred and recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction, until the transaction matures, is closed out, the valuation inputs become observable or the group enters into an offsetting transaction.

The fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on an individual basis. However, in cases where the group manages a group of financial assets and liabilities according to its net market or credit risk exposure, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis but the underlying financial assets and liabilities are presented separately in the financial statements, unless they satisfy the IFRS Accounting Standard offsetting criteria. Financial instruments are classified into one of three fair value hierarchy levels, described in Note 11, 'Fair values of financial instruments carried at fair value'.

## Critical estimates and judgements

The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data. However, certain financial instruments are classified on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable, and for them, the measurement of fair value is more judgemental:

## Judgements

## Estimates

- – An instrument in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable inputs if, in the opinion of management, greater than 5% of the instrument's valuation is driven by unobservable inputs.
- – 'Unobservable' in this context means that there is little or no current market data available from which to determine the price at which an arm's length transaction would be likely to occur. It generally does not mean that there is no data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value (consensus pricing data may, for example, be used).

## (d) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost

Financial assets that are held to collect the contractual cash flows and which contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Such financial assets include most loans and advances to banks and customers and some debt securities. In addition, most financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. The group accounts for regular way amortised cost financial instruments using trade date accounting. The carrying value of these financial assets at initial recognition includes any directly attributable transactions costs.

The group may commit to underwriting loans on fixed contractual terms for specified periods of time. When the loan arising from the lending commitment is expected to be sold shortly after origination, the commitment to lend is recorded as a derivative. When the group intends to hold the loan, the loan commitment is included in the impairment calculations.

Financial assets are reclassified only when the business model for their management changes. Such changes, which are expected to be infrequent, are determined by senior management as a result of external or internal changes and must be significant to operations and demonstrable to external parties. Reclassifications are applied prospectively from the first day of the first reporting period following the change of business model. Where a financial asset is reclassified from a hold-to-collect business model into a fair value through other comprehensive income business model, its fair value is measured at the date of reclassification. Any gain or loss arising from a difference between the previous amortised cost and fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income.

## Non-trading reverse repurchase, repurchase and similar agreements

When debt securities are sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them at a predetermined price ('repos'), they remain on the balance sheet and a liability is recorded in respect of the consideration received. Securities purchased under commitments to resell ('reverse repos') are not recognised on the balance sheet and an asset is recorded in respect of the initial consideration paid. Non-trading repos and reverse repos are measured at amortised cost. The difference between the sale and repurchase price or between the purchase and resale price is treated as interest and recognised in net interest income over the life of the agreement.

Contracts that are economically equivalent to reverse repurchase or repurchase agreements (such as sales or purchases of debt securities entered into together with total return swaps with the same counterparty) are accounted for similarly to, and presented together with, reverse repurchase or repurchase agreements.

## (e) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI')

Financial assets managed within a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling and which contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are measured at FVOCI. These comprise primarily debt securities. They are recognised on the trade date when the group enters into contractual arrangements to purchase and are generally recognised when they are either sold or redeemed. They are subsequently remeasured at fair value with changes therein (except for those relating to impairment, interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses) are recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold. Upon disposal, the cumulative gains or losses in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement as 'Gains less losses from financial instruments'. Financial assets measured at FVOCI are included in the impairment calculations and impairment is recognised in profit or loss.

## (f) Equity securities measured at fair value with fair value movements presented in other comprehensive income ('OCI')

The equity securities for which fair value movements are shown in OCI are business facilitation and other similar investments where the group holds the investments other than to generate a capital return. Dividends from such investments are recognised in profit or loss. Gains or losses on the derecognition of these equity securities are not transferred to profit or loss. Otherwise, equity securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

## (g) Financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss

Financial instruments, other than those held for trading, are classified in this category if they meet one or more of the criteria set out below and are so designated irrevocably at inception:

- -The use of the designation removes or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.
- -A group of financial assets and liabilities or a group of financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.
- -The financial liability contains one or more non-closely related embedded derivatives.

Designated financial assets are recognised when the group enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on trade date, and are normally derecognised when the rights to the cash flows expire or are transferred. Designated financial liabilities are recognised when the group enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on settlement date, and are normally derecognised when extinguished. Subsequent changes in fair values are recognised in the income statement in 'Net income from financial instruments held for trading or

managed on a fair value basis' except for the effect of changes in the liabilities' credit risk, which is presented in 'Other comprehensive income', unless that treatment would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.

Under the above criterion, the main classes of financial instruments designated by the group are:

- -Debt instruments for funding purposes that are designated to reduce an accounting mismatch: The interest and/or foreign exchange exposure on certain fixed-rate debt securities issued has been matched with the interest and/or foreign exchange exposure on certain swaps as part of a documented risk management strategy.
- -Financial liabilities that contain both deposit and derivative components: These financial liabilities are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis.

## (h) Derivatives

Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of underlying items such as equities, interest rates or other indices. Derivatives are recognised initially and are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative. This includes embedded derivatives in financial liabilities which are bifurcated from the host contract when they meet the definition of a derivative on a stand-alone basis.

Where the derivatives are managed with debt securities issued by the group that are designated at fair value where doing so reduces an accounting mismatch, the contractual interest is shown in 'Interest expense' together with the interest payable on the issued debt.

## Hedge accounting

When derivatives are not part of fair value designated relationships, if held for risk management purposes they are designated in hedge accounting relationships where the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness are met. Group uses these derivatives or, where allowed, other non-derivative hedging instruments in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations as appropriate to the risk being hedged.

## Fair value hedge

Fair value hedge accounting does not change the recording of gains and losses on derivatives and other hedging instruments, but results in recognising changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities attributable to the hedged risk that would not otherwise be recognised in the income statement. If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued and the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest rate method is used is amortised to the income statement on a recalculated effective interest rate, unless the hedged item has been derecognised, in which case it is recognised in the income statement immediately.

## Cash flow hedge

The effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of derivative hedging instruments that are part of a cash flow hedge relationship is recognised immediately in the income statement within 'Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis'. The accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement in the same periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. Hedged items that have affected profit or loss are primarily recorded within interest income. When a hedge relationship is discontinued, or partially discontinued, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income remains in equity until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to the income statement.

## Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting

Non-qualifying hedges are derivatives entered into as economic hedges of assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting was not applied.

## (i) Impairment of amortised cost and FVOCI financial assets

Expected credit losses are recognised for loans and advances to banks and customers, non-trading reverse repurchase agreements, other financial assets held at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial guarantees) is recognised for ECL resulting from possible default events within the next 12 months (or less, where the remaining life is less than 12 months) ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, allowance (or provision) is recognised for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument ('lifetime ECL'). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered to be 'stage 1'; financial assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in 'stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, and so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit-impaired are in 'stage 3'. Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets ('POCI') are treated differently as set out below.

## Credit-impaired (stage 3)

The group determines that a financial instrument is credit impaired and in stage 3 by considering relevant objective evidence, primarily whether contractual payments of either principal or interest are past due for more than 90 days, there are other indications that the borrower is unlikely to pay such that a concession has been granted to the borrower for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial condition, or the loan is otherwise considered to be in default.

If such unlinkeliness to pay is not identified at an earlier stage, it is deemed to occur when an exposure is 90 days past due. Therefore, the definitions of credit impaired and default are aligned as far as possible so that stage 3 represents all loans that are considered defaulted or otherwise credit impaired.

## Write-off

Financial assets (and the related impairment allowances) are normally written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Where loans are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realisation of security. In circumstances where the net realisable value of any collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, write-off may be earlier.

## Forbearance

Loans are identified as forborne and classified as either performing or non-performing when we modify the contractual terms due to financial difficulty of the borrower. Non-performing forborne loans are stage 3 and classified as non-performing until they meet the cure criteria, as specified by applicable credit risk policy (for example, when the loan is no longer in default and no other indicators of default have been present for at least 12 months). Any amount written off as a result of any modification of contractual terms upon entering forbearance would not be reversed.

Performing forborne loans are initially stage 2 and remain classified as forborne until they meet applicable cure criteria (for example, they continue to not be in default and no other indicators of default are present for a period of at least 24 months). At this point, the loan is either stage 1 or stage 2 as determined by comparing the risk of a default occurring at the reporting date (based on the modified contractual terms) and the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified contractual terms).

A forborne loan is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement is made on substantially different terms, or if the terms of an existing agreement are modified such that the forborne loan is a substantially different financial instrument. Any new loans that arise following derecognition events in these circumstances would generally be classified as POCI and will continue to be disclosed as forborne.

## Loan modifications other than forborne loans

Loan modifications that are not identified as forborne are considered to be commercial restructuring results. Where a commercial restructuring results in a modification (whether legalised through an amendment to the existing terms or the issuance of a new loan contract) such that group's rights to the cash flows under the original contract have expired, the old loan is recognised and the new loan is recognised at fair value. The rights to cash flows are generally considered to have expired if the commercial restructuring is at market rates and no payment-related concession has been provided. Modifications of certain higher credit risk wholesale loans are assessed for derecognition having regard to changes in contractual terms that either individually or in combination are judged to result in a substantially different financial instrument. Mandatory and general offer loan modifications that are not borrower specific, for example market-wide customer relief programmes generally do not result in derecognition, but their stage allocation is determined considering all available and supportable information under our ECL impairment policy. Changes made to these financial instruments that are economically equivalent and required by interest rate benchmark reform do not result in the derecognition or a change in the carrying amount of the financial instrument, but instead require the effective interest rate to be updated to reflect the change of the interest rate benchmark.

## Significant increase in credit risk (stage 2)

An assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition is performed at each reporting period by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument.

The assessment explicitly or implicitly compares the risk of default occurring at the reporting date compared with that at initial recognition, taking into account reasonable and supportable information, including information about past events, current conditions and future economic conditions. The assessment is unbiased, probability-weighted, and to the extent relevant, uses forward-looking information consistent with that used in the measurement of ECL. The analysis of credit risk is multifactor. The determination of whether a specific factor is relevant and its weight compared with other factors depends on the type of product, the characteristics of the financial instrument and the borrower, and the geographical region. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a single set of criteria that will determine what is considered to be a significant increase in credit risk and these criteria will differ for different types of lending, particularly between retail and wholesale. However, unless identified at an earlier stage, all financial assets are deemed to have suffered a significant increase in credit risk when 30 days past due. In addition, wholesale loans that are individually assessed, which are typically corporate and commercial customers, and included on a watch or worry list are included in stage 2.

For wholesale portfolios, the quantitative comparison assesses default risk using a lifetime probability of default ('PD') which encompasses a wide range of information including the obligor's customer risk rating ('CRR'), macroeconomic condition forecasts and credit transition probabilities. For origination CRRs up to 3.3, significant increase in credit risk is measured by comparing the average PD for the remaining term estimated at origination with the equivalent estimation at the reporting date. The quantitative measure of significance varies depending on the credit quality at origination as follows:

| Origination CRR   | Significance trigger – PD to increase by   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0.1-1.2           | 15 bps                                     |
| 2.1-3.3           | 30 bps                                     |

For CRRs greater than 3.3 that are not impaired, a significant increase in credit risk is considered to have occurred when the origination PD has doubled. The significance of changes in PD was informed by expert credit risk judgement, referenced to historical credit migrations and to relative changes in external market rates.

For loans originated prior to the implementation of IFRS 9, the origination PD does not include adjustments to reflect expectations of future macroeconomic conditions since these are not available without the use of hindsight. In the absence of this data, origination PD must be approximated assuming through-the-cycle PDs and through-the-cycle migration probabilities, consistent with the instrument's underlying modelling approach and the CRR at origination. For these loans, and for all the loans, the quantitative comparison is supplemented with additional CRR deterioration based thresholds as set out in the table below:

| Origination CRR   | Additional significance criteria - Number of CRR grade notches deterioration required to identify as significant credit deterioration (stage 2) (> or equal to)   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0.1               | 5 notches                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.1-4.2           | 4 notches                                                                                                                                                         |

Further information about the 23-grade scale used for CRR can be found on page 56.

For retail portfolios, default risk is assessed using a reporting date 12-month PD derived from internally developed statistical models, which incorporate all available information about the customer. This PD is adjusted for the effect of macroeconomic forecasts for periods longer than 12 months and is considered to be a reasonable approximation of a lifetime PD measure. Retail exposures are first segmented into homogeneous portfolios, generally by country, product and brand. Within each portfolio, the stage 2 accounts are defined as accounts with an adjusted 12-month PD greater than the average 12-month PD of loans in that portfolio 12 months before they become 30 days past due.

The expert credit risk judgement is that no prior increase in credit risk is significant. This portfolio-specific threshold therefore identifies loans with a PD higher than would be expected from loans that are performing as originally expected and higher than that which would have been acceptable at origination. It therefore approximates a comparison of origination to reporting date PDs.

We continue to refine the retail transfer criteria approach for certain portfolios as additional data becomes available, in order to utilise a more relative approach. These enhancements take advantage of the increase in origination-related data in the assessment of significant increases in credit risk by comparing remaining lifetime PD to the comparable remaining term lifetime PD at origination based on portfolio-specific origination segments.

## Unimpaired and without significant increase in credit risk (stage 1)

ECL resulting from possible default events within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL') are recognised for financial instruments that remain in stage 1.

## Purchased or originated credit impaired

Financial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses are considered to be POCI. This population includes new financial instruments recognised in most cases following the derecognition of forborne loans. The amount of change in lifetime ECL for a POCI loan is recognised in profit or loss until the POCI loan is derecognised, even if the lifetime ECL are less than the amount of ECL included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.

## Movement between stages

Financial assets can be transferred between the different categories (other than POCI) depending on their relative increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Financial instruments are transferred out of stage 2 if their credit risk is no longer considered to be significantly increased since initial recognition based on the assessments described above. In the case of non-performing forborne loans, such financial instruments are transferred out of stage 3 when no longer exhibit any evidence of credit impairment and meet the curing criteria as described above.

## Measurement of ECL

The assessment of credit risk, and the estimation of ECL, are unbiased and probability-weighted, and incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money and considers other factors such as climate-related risks.

In general, the group calculates ECL using three main components, a PD, a loss given default ('LGD') and the exposure at default ('EAD').

The 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the lifetime PD instead. The 12-month and lifetime PD represents the PD occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.

The EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised and the time value of money.

The group makes use of the IRB framework where possible, with recalibration to meet the differing IFRS 9 requirements as set out in the following table:

The cash flows are discounted at a reasonable approximation of the original effective interest rate. For significant cases, cash flows under up to four different scenarios are probability-weighted by reference to the status of the borrower, economic scenarios applied more generally by the group and judgement in relation to the likelihood of the work-out strategy succeeding or receivership being required. For less significant cases where an individual assessment is undertaken, the effect of different economic scenarios and work-out strategies results in an ECL calculation based on a most likely outcome which is adjusted to capture losses resulting from less likely but possible outcomes. For certain less significant cases, the group may use a LGD-based modelled approach to ECL assessment, which factors in a range of economic scenarios.

## Period over which ECL is measured

Expected credit loss is measured from the initial recognition of the financial asset. The maximum period considered when measuring ECL (be it 12-month or lifetime ECL) is the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. However, where the financial instrument includes both a drawn and undrawn commitment and the contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not serve to limit group's exposure to credit risk to the contractual notice period, the contractual period does not determine the maximum period considered. Instead, ECL is measured over the period the group remains exposed to credit risk that is not mitigated by credit risk management actions. This applies to retail overdrafts and credit cards, where the period is the average time taken for stage 2 exposures to default or close as performing accounts, determined on a portfolio basis and ranging from between two and six years. In addition, for these facilities it is not possible to identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from the financial asset component. As a result, the total ECL is recognised in the loss allowance for the financial asset unless the total ECL exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, in which case the ECL is recognised as a provision. For wholesale overdraft facilities, credit risk management actions are taken no less frequently than on an annual basis.

## Forward-looking economic inputs

The group applies multiple forward-looking global economic scenarios determined with reference to external forecast distributions representative of our view of forecast economic conditions. This approach is considered sufficient to calculate unbiased expected loss in most economic environments. In certain economic environments, additional analysis may be necessary and may result in additional scenarios or adjustments, to reflect a range of possible economic outcomes sufficient for an unbiased estimate. The detailed methodology is disclosed in 'Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates' on page 47.

## Critical estimates and judgements

The calculation of the group's ECL under IFRS 9 requires the group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. The most significant are set out below:

| Judgements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Estimates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## (j) Employee compensation and benefits

## Share-based payments

Shares in HSBC Holdings plc are awarded to employees in certain cases. Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements entitle employees to receive equity instruments of HSBC.

The vesting period for these schemes may commence before the legal grant date if the employees have started to render services in respect of the award before the legal grant date, where there is a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Expenses are recognised when the employee starts to render service to which the award relates.

Cancellations result from the failure to meet a non-vesting condition during the vesting period, and are treated as an acceleration of vesting recognised immediately in the income statement. Failure to meet a vesting condition by the employee is not treated as a cancellation, and the amount of expense recognised for the award is adjusted to reflect the number of awards expected to vest.

## Post-employment benefit plans

The group contributes to the Government pension and social security schemes in the countries in which it operates, as per local regulations. Where the group's obligations under the plans are equivalent to a defined contribution plan the payments made are charged as an expense as they fall due. End of service benefits are calculated and paid in accordance with local law. The group's net obligation in respect of such end of service benefits is the amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in current and prior periods.

Defined benefit pension obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. The net charge to the income statement mainly comprises the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit asset or liability, and is presented in operating expenses.

Re-measurements of the net defined benefit asset or liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The net defined benefit asset or liability represents the present value of defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of plan assets, after applying the asset ceiling test, where the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The cost of obligations arising from other post-employment plans are accounted for on the same basis as defined benefit pension plans.

## Critical estimates and judgements

The most significant critical estimates relate to the determination of key assumptions applied in calculating the defined benefit pension obligation for the principal plan.

## (k) Tax

Income tax comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is recognised in the same statement as the related item appears.

Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year and on any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. The group provides for potential current tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, and the amounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled.

In assessing the probability and sufficiency of future taxable profit, management considers the availability of evidence to support the recognition of deferred tax assets, taking into account the inherent risks in long-term forecasting, including climate change-related, and drivers of recent history of tax losses where applicable. Management also considers the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies, including corporate reorganisations.

Current and deferred tax are calculated based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.

## Critical estimates and judgements

The recognition of deferred tax assets depends on judgements and estimates.

## (I) Provisions, contingent liabilities and guarantees

## Provisions

Provisions are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a present legal or constructive obligation which has arisen as a result of past events and for which a reliable estimate can be made.

## Critical estimates and judgements

The recognition and measurement of provisions requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. The most significant are set out below:

## Contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees

## Contingent liabilities

Contingent liabilities, which include certain guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings or regulatory matters, are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of settlement is remote.

## Financial guarantee contracts

Liabilities under financial guarantee contracts which are not classified as insurance contracts are recorded initially at their fair value, which is generally the fee received or present value of the fee receivable.

## (m) Impairment of non-financial assets

Software under development is tested for impairment at least annually. Other non-financial assets are property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and right-of-use assets. They are tested for impairment at the individual asset level when there is indication of impairment at that level, or at the Cash Generating Unit ('CGU') level for assets that do not have a recoverable amount at the individual asset level. In addition, impairment is also tested at the CGU level when there is indication of impairment at that level. For this purpose, CGUs are considered to be the legal entity divided by global business.

Impairment testing compares the carrying amount of the non-financial asset of CGU with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal or the value in use. The carrying amount of a CGU comprises the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, including non-financial assets that are directly attributable to it and non-financial assets that can be allocated to it on a reasonable and consistent basis. Non-financial assets that cannot be allocated to an individual CGU are tested for impairment at an appropriate grouping of CGUs. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal of the CGU, which is determined by independent and qualified valuers where relevant, and the value in use, which is calculated based on appropriate inputs.

When the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the impairment can be allocated on a pro-rata basis to the non-financial assets by reducing their carrying amounts to the higher of their respective individual recoverable amount or nil. Impairment is not allocated to the financial assets in a CGU.

Impairment loss recognised in prior periods for non-financial assets is reversed when there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the non-financial assets would not exceed the amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.

## Post-employment defined benefit plans' principal actuarial financial assumptions

The principal actuarial financial assumptions used to calculate the group's obligations under its defined benefit pension plans at 31 December for each year, and used as the basis for measuring periodic costs under the plans in the following years, were as follows:

Key actuarial assumptions for the principal plan

|                      | Discount rate   | Rate of pay increase   | Combined rate of resignation and employment termination %   |
|----------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|

| At 31 Dec 2024       | 3.4             | 6.0                    | 9.9                                                         |
| At 31 Dec 2023       | 4.5             | 6.0                    | 11.7                                                        |

The group determines discount rates to be applied to its obligations in consultation with the plans' local actuaries, on the basis of current average yields of long-term government bonds.

Accounting for taxes involves some estimation because the tax law is uncertain and the application requires a degree of judgement, which authorities may dispute. Liabilities are recognised based on best estimates of the probable outcome, taking into account external advice where appropriate. We do not expect significant liabilities to arise in excess of the amounts provided. The group only recognises current and deferred tax assets where recovery is probable.

## Other information

## New UAE corporate tax regime

The UAE Ministry of Finance released Federal Decree - Law No. 47 of 2022 on the Taxation of Corporations and Businesses enacting a Federal Corporate Income tax ('FCIT') regime in the UAE with effective date of 1 January 2024 for the group. Under the new FCIT tax regime, the group will be subject to a 9% Corporate Income tax ('CIT') on its taxable income, subject to relevant tax reliefs and credit as available. The group is already subject to a 20% CIT on its Banking operations under the tax regimes of the individual Emirates. The resulting double taxation was mitigated by the Emirates of Dubai and Shahjahan as they have amended their Law to provide for a tax credit for the FCIT.

Dubai Emirate have announced a new tax decree in March 2024 providing relief for FCIT through a reduction of corporate tax rate from 20% to 11% basis which DTA was revalued and write-down for approximately US$42m (booked in first half of 2024) along with the remeasurement of the DTA for the current year at 11%. In December 2024 Dubai Emirates released an Administrative Decision ('AD') which changed the approach for tax relief against FCIT to tax credit (reduction in tax liability rather than a reduction in tax rate). In effect, the DTA position for FY2024 has been reinstated at tax rate of 20% for Dubai Emirate and the DTA write-down in first half of 2024 of approximately US$42m has been reversed. The new Tax Law also repealed the tax exemption historically enjoyed by the Jebel Ali freezone Branches.

The Emirates of Abu Dhabi, Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah are yet to issue their amended Tax laws to provide for a similar form of tax credit against the FCIT. In the absence of an official publication by these 3 Emirates on the reporting date, the group has provided for tax on the profits of these Emirates at a rate of 29%.

## Global Minimum Tax regime

In July 2023, legislation was enacted in the UK, the jurisdiction of the group's ultimate parent entity, HSBC Holdings plc, to introduce the 'Pillar Two' Global Minimum Tax model rules of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ('OECD') under the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('BEPS'), and a Qualified Domestic Minimum top-up tax ('QDMTT') with effect from 1 January 2024.

Under these rules, a top-up tax liability arises where the effective tax rate of the group's operations in a jurisdiction, calculated based on principles set out in the OECD's Pillar Two model rules, is below 15%. Any top-up tax arising in relation to judsictions in which a QDMTT applies will be payable to the tax authority in that jurisdiction. Where there is no QDMTT, the top-up tax is payable by HSBC Holdings plc, being the group's ultimate parent, to the UK tax authority.

In response to the OECD's Pillar Two model rules, many national governments have introduced or announced their intention to introduce QDMTT rules that are closely aligned to the OECD's Pillar Two model rules. Where such QDMTT rules are introduced, they may be expected to have the effect of increasing the local tax rate to a minimum of 15%.

In relation to the group entities, tax legislation has been substantively enacted in the UAE and Bahrain and announced in Qatar, Kuwait, and Oman to implement a QDMTT effective from 1 January 2025. The application of the Pillar Two global minimum tax rules and the introduction of QDMTT is expected to have no material impact for the year ending 31 December 2025. However, the tax impact is dependent upon the ongoing evolution of rules and guidance in the relevant tax jurisdictions.

## 11 Fair values of financial instruments carried at fair value

## Control framework

Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that they are either determined or validated by a function independent of the risk taker.

Where fair values are determined by reference to externally quoted prices or observable pricing inputs to models, independent price determination or validation is used. For inactive markets, the group sources alternative market information, with greater weight given to information that is considered to be more relevant and reliable. Examples of the factors considered are price observability, instrument comparability, consistency of data sources, underlying data accuracy and timing of prices.

For fair values determined using valuation models, the control framework includes development or validation by independent support functions of the model logic, inputs, model outputs and adjustments. Valuation models are subject to a process of due diligence before becoming operational and are calibrated against external market data on an ongoing basis.

The majority of financial instruments measured at fair value are in GB and MSS, and their fair value governance structure comprises its Finance function, Valuation Committee and a Valuation Committee Review Group. Finance is responsible for establishing procedures governing valuation and ensuring fair values are in compliance with accounting standards. The fair values are reviewed by the Valuation Committees, which consist of independent support functions. These Committees are overseen by the Valuation Committee Review Group, which considers all material subjective valuations.

## Financial liabilities measured at fair value

In certain circumstances, the group records its own debt in issue at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market for the specific instrument concerned, where available. An example of this is where own debt in issue is hedged with interest rate derivatives. When quoted market prices are unavailable, the own debt in issue is valued using valuation techniques, the inputs for which are either based upon quoted prices in an inactive market for the instrument, or are estimated by comparison with quoted prices in an active market for similar instruments. In both cases, the fair value includes the effect of applying the credit spread which is appropriate to the group's liabilities. The change in fair value of issued debt securities attributable to the group's own credit spread is computed as follows: for each security at each reporting date, an externally verifiable price is obtained or a price is derived using credit spreads for similar securities for the same issuer. Then, using discounted cash flow, each security is valued using an appropriate market discount curve. The difference in the valuations is attributable to the group's own credit spread. This methodology is applied consistently across all securities.

The credit spread applied to these instruments is derived from the spreads at which the group issues structured notes.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the credit spread of liabilities issued by the group is recorded in other comprehensive income, the residual risks (rates, volatility, time effects) are fair valued through profit and loss.

## Fair value hierarchy

Fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined according to the following hierarchy:

- -Level 1 - valuation technique using quoted market price: financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets that the group can access at the measurement date.
- -Level 2 - valuation technique using observable inputs: financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.
- -Level 3 - valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs: financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable.

The balance as at 31 December 2024 under financial assets mandaturily measured at fair value through profit or loss is US$11m (2023: US$10m).

Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to occur at the end of each quarter reporting period. Transfers into and out of levels of the fair value hierarchy are primarily attributable to observability of valuation inputs and price transparency.

During 2024, US$237m of Financial Investments transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 (2023: US$72m). There were no other transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. The transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 are presented in 'Movement in Level 3 financial instruments' on page 30.

## Fair value adjustments

Fair value adjustments are adopted when the group considers that there are additional factors that would be considered by a market participant which are not incorporated within the valuation model.

Movements in the level of fair value adjustments do not necessarily result in the recognition of profits or losses within the income statement. For example, as models are enhanced, fair value adjustments may no longer be required.

## Bid-offer

JERKS 13 requires use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value. Valuation models will typically generate mid-market values. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer cost would be incurred if substantially all residual net portfolio market risks were closed using available hedging instruments or by disposing of or unwinning the position.

## Uncertainty

Certain model inputs may be less readily determinable from market data, and/or the choice of model itself may be more subjective. In these circumstances, there exists a range of possible values that the financial instrument or market parameter may assume and an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the likelihood that in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument, market participants would adopt more conservative values for uncertain parameters and/or model assumptions than those used in the valuation model.

## Credit and debit valuation adjustment

The credit valuation adjustment is an adjustment to the valuation of over-the-counter ('OTC') derivative contracts to reflect within fair value the possibility that the counterparty may default and that the group may not receive the full market value of the transactions.

The debit valuation adjustment is an adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect within fair value the possibility that the group may default, and that the group may not pay full market value of the transactions.

## Funding fair value adjustment

The funding fair value adjustment is calculated by applying future market funding spreads to the expected future funding exposure of any uncollateralised component of the OTC derivative portfolio. This includes the uncollateralised component of collateralised derivatives in addition to derivatives that are fully uncollateralised. The expected future funding exposure is calculated by a simulation methodology, where available. The expected future funding exposure is adjusted for events that may terminate the exposure such as the default of the group or the counterparty.

## Inception profit (Day 1 P&amp;L reserves)

Inception profit adjustments are adopted when the fair value estimated by a valuation model is based on one or more significant unobservable inputs.

## Fair value valuation bases

## Private equity including strategic investments

The investment's fair value is estimated on the basis of an analysis of the investee's financial position and results, risk profile, prospects and other factors; by reference to market valuations for similar entities quoted in an active market; or the price at which similar companies have changed ownership.

## Derivatives

OTC derivatives are valued using valuation models. Valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based upon 'no-arbitrage' principles. For many vanilla derivative products, such as interest rate swaps and European options, the modelling approaches used are standard across the industry. For more complex derivative products, there may be some differences in market practice. Inputs to valuation models are determined from observable market data wherever possible, including prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of consensus pricing. Certain inputs may not be observable in the market directly, but can be determined from observable prices via model calibration procedures or estimated from historical data or other sources.

1 Derivatives and trading assets are presented as one category to reflect the manner in which these instruments are risk-managed.

The sensitivity analysis aims to measure a range of fair values consistent with the application of a 95% confidence interval. Methodologies take account of the nature of the valuation technique employed, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data. When the fair value of a financial instrument is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the above table reflects the most favourable or the most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually.

## Valuation

The fair value measurement is the group's estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It does not reflect the economic benefits and costs that the group expects to flow from the instruments' cash flows over their expected future lives. Other reporting entities may use different valuation methodologies and assumptions in determining fair values for which no observable market prices are available.

## Loans and advances to banks and customers

The fair value of loans and advances is based on observable  market transactions, where available. In the absence of observable market transactions, fair value is estimated using valuation models that incorporate a range of input assumptions. These assumptions may include forward looking discounted cash flow models using assumptions which the group believes are consistent with those which would be used by market participants in valuing such loans; and trading inputs from other market participants which includes observed primary and secondary trades.

Loans are grouped, as far as possible, into homogeneous groups and stratified by loans with similar characteristics to improve the accuracy of estimated valuation outputs. The stratification of a loan book considers all material factors, including vintage, origination period, estimates of future interest rates, prepayment speeds, delinquency rates, loan-to-value ratios, the quality of collateral, default probability, and internal credit risk ratings.

The fair value of a loan reflects both loan impairments at the balance sheet date and estimates of market participants' expectations of credit losses over the life of the loans, and the fair value effect of repricing between origination and the balance sheet date.

## Financial investments

The fair values of listed financial investments are determined using market prices. The fair values of unlisted financial investments are determined using valuation techniques that take into consideration the prices and future earnings streams of equivalent quoted securities.

## Deposits by banks and customer accounts

Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of a deposit repayable on demand is approximated by its carrying value.

## Debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities

Fair values are determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date where available, or by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments.

## Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements - non-trading

Fair values approximate carrying amounts as their balances are generally short dated.

The notional contract amounts of derivatives held for trading purposes and derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships indicate the nominal value of transactions outstanding at the balance sheet date; they do not represent amounts at risk.

## Use of derivatives

The group transacts derivatives for three primary purposes: to create risk management solutions for clients, to manage the portfolio risks arising from client business and to manage and hedge the group's own risks.

The group's derivative activities give rise to significant open positions in portfolios of derivatives. These positions are managed constantly to ensure that they remain within acceptable risk levels. When entering into derivative transactions, the group employs the same credit risk management framework to assess and approve potential credit exposures that it uses for traditional lending.

## Trading derivatives

Most of the group's derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities include marketmaking and risk management. Market-making entails quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants for the purpose of generating revenues based on spread and volume. Risk management activity is undertaken to manage the risk arising from client transactions, with the principal purpose of retaining client margin. Other derivatives classified as held for trading include non-qualifying hedging derivatives.

## Hedge accounting derivatives

## Hedged risk components

The group designates a portion of cash flows of a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments for a specific interest rate or foreign currency risk component in a fair value or cash flow hedge. The designated risks and portions are either contractually specified or otherwise separately identifiable components of the financial instrument that are reliably measurable. Risk-free or benchmark interest rates generally are regarded as being both separately identifiable and reliably measurable, where the group designates Alternative Benchmark Rates as the hedged risk which may not have been separately identifiable upon initial designation, provided the group reasonably expects it will meet the requirement within 24 months from the first designation date. The designated risk component accounts for a significant portion of the overall changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item(s).

## Fair value hedges

The group enters into fixed-for-floating-interest-rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in fair value due to movements in market interest rates on certain fixed rate financial instruments which are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, including debt securities held and issued.

1 Used in effectiveness assessment; comprising amount attributable to the designated hedged risk that can be a risk component. The hedged item is either the benchmark interest rate risk portion within the fixed rate of the hedged item or the full fixed rate and it is hedged for changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate risk.

Sources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from basis risk including but not limited to the discount rates used for calculating the fair value of derivatives, hedges using instruments with a non-zero fair value and notional and timing differences between the hedged items and hedging instruments.

## Cash flow hedges

The group's cash flow hedging instruments consist principally of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps that are used to manage the variability in future interest cash flows of non-trading financial assets and liabilities, arising due to changes in market interest rates and foreigncurrency basis.

The group applies macro cash flow hedging for interest-rate risk exposures on portfolios of replenishing current and forecasted issuances of non-trading assets and liabilities that bear interest at variable rates, including rolling such instruments. The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults. The aggregate cash flows representing both principal balances and interest cash flows across all portfolios are used to determine the effectiveness and ineffectiveness.

The group also hedges the variability in future cash-flows on foreign-denominated financial assets and liabilities arising due to changes in foreign exchange market rates with cross-currency swaps.

1 As at 31 December 2024, net book value of HSBC Tower was US$205m (2023: US$215m) and depreciation charged during the year was US$9m (2023: US$9m).

## Endorsements and acceptances

Acceptances arise when the group is under an obligation to make payments against documents drawn under letters of credit. Acceptances specify the amount of money, the date, and the person to which the payment is due. After acceptance, the instrument becomes an unconditional liability of the group and is therefore recognised as a financial liability with a corresponding contractual right of reimbursement from the customer recognised as a financial asset.

## 19 Intangible assets

Included within intangible assets is internally generated software with a net carrying value of US$265m (2023: US$247m).

During the year, capitalisation of internally generated software was US$83m (2023: US$97m), amortisation and impairment was US$66m (2023: US$50m).

Subordinated liabilities rank behind senior obligations and generally count towards the capital base of the group. Capital securities may be called and redeemed by the group subject to prior notification to the DFSA. Subordinated liabilities carry a coupon of SOFR + Margin 2.09%(2023: SOFR + Margin 2.70%). The balance sheet amounts disclosed in the above table are presented on an IFRS basis and may not reflect the amount that the instruments contribute to regulatory capital.

## 27 Maturity analysis of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments

The following is an analysis by remaining contractual maturities at the balance sheet date, of assets and liability line items that combine amounts expected to be recovered or settled within one year and after more than one year.

- -Trading assets and liabilities (excluding reverse repos, repos and debt securities in issue), and trading derivatives are included in the 'Due within 3 months' time bucket, because trading balances are typically held for short periods of time.
- -Financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity (such as equity securities) are included in the 'Due after 5 years' time bucket. Undated or perpetual instruments are classified based on the contractual notice period, which the counterparty of the instrument is entitled to give. Where there is no contractual notice period, undated or perpetual contracts are included in the 'Due after 5 years' time bucket.
- -Non-financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity are included in the 'Due after 5 years' time bucket.
- -Loan and other credit-related commitments are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be drawn down.

The above table shows, on an undiscounted basis, all cash flows relating to principal and future coupon payments (except for trading liabilities and derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives). For this reason, balances in the above table do not agree directly with those in our consolidated balance sheet. Undiscounted cash flows payable in relation to hedging derivative liabilities are classified according to their contractual maturities. Trading liabilities and derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives are included in the 'On demand' time bucket and not by contractual maturity.

Further discussion of the group's liquidity and funding management can be found in Note 31 'Risk management'.

## 28 Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously ('the offset criteria').

The 'Amounts not set off in the balance sheet' include transactions where:

- -the counterparty has an offsetting exposure with the group and a master netting or similar arrangement is in place with a right to set off only in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy, or the offset criteria are otherwise not satisfied; and
- -in the case of derivatives and reverse repurchase/repurchase, stock borrowing/lending and similar agreements, cash and non-cash collateral (debt securities and equities) has been received/pledged to cover net exposure in the event of a default or other predetermined events.

Amounts not subject to enforceable master netting agreements' include contracts executed in jurisdictions where the rights of set off may not be upheld under the local bankruptcy laws, and transactions where a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the right of offset may not have been sought, or may have been unable to obtain.

For risk management purposes, the net amounts of loans and advances to customers are subject to limits, which are monitored and the relevant customer agreements are subject to review and updated, as necessary, to ensure that the legal right to set off remains appropriate.

## 31 Risk management

## Our approach to risk

## Our risk management

All the group's activities involve, to varying degrees, the analysis, evaluation, acceptance and active management of risks or combinations of risks. The key financial risks which the group is exposed to are retail and wholesale credit risk (including cross-border country risk), market risk (predominantly foreign exchange and interest rate risks), liquidity and funding risk and strategic risk (including reputational risk). The group is also exposed to non-financial risk in various forms (including Resilience risk, Financial Crime and Fraud Risk, People Risk, Regulatory Compliance Risk, Legal Risk, Financial Reporting and Tax risks and Model Risks). The Group is committed to managing and mitigating climaterelated risks, both physical and transition risks, and continue to incorporate consideration of these into how we manage and oversee risks internally and with our customers.

We recognise the importance of a strong culture, which refers to our shared attitudes, beliefs, values and standards that shape behaviours including those related to risk awareness, risk taking and risk management. All our people are responsible for the management of risk, with ultimate supervisory oversight residing with the Board.

The implementation of our business strategy, which includes transformation, remains a key focus. As we implement change initiatives, we actively manage the execution risks. We aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organisation and across all risk

types, underpinned by our culture and values. This is outlined in our risk management framework, including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks, both financial and non-financial. The framework fosters continual monitoring, promotes risk awareness and encourages a sound operational and strategic decision making process. It also supports a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities. We actively review and enhance our risk management framework and our approach to managing risk, through our activities with regard to: people and capabilities; governance; reporting and management information; credit risk management models; and data.

## Our risk management framework

The following table and descriptions summarise key aspects of the risk management framework, including governance, structure, our risk management tools and our culture, which together help align employee behaviour with our risk appetite.

Key components of our risk management framework

## HSBC Values and risk culture

## Risk culture

The group's strong risk governance reflects the importance placed by the Board on managing risks effectively. It is supported by a clear policy framework of risk ownership and by the accountability of all staff for identifying, assessing and managing risks within the scope of their assigned responsibilities. This personal accountability, reinforced by the governance structure, experience and mandatory learning, helps to foster a disciplined and constructive culture of risk management and control throughout the group and one that supports and encourages the behaviours of good judgement, speaking-up and accountability.

## Risk governance and ownership

The Board has ultimate responsibility for the effective management of risk and approves the risk appetite. The Audit and Risk Committees are responsible for advising the Board on material risk matters and provide non-executive oversight of risks. Under authority delegated by the Board Risk Committee, the separately convened Executive Risk Management Meeting ('RMM') formulates high-level risk management policy and oversees the implementation of risk appetite and controls. The RMM together with the Asset and Liability Committee ('ALCO') monitors all categories of risk, receives reports on actual performance and emerging issues, determines action to be taken and reviews the efficacy of our risk management framework.

The Chief Risk and Compliance Officer ('CRCO') chairs the RMM of the Executive Committee. The membership of the Executive Committee ensures that the committee oversees risk management matters across the three lines of defence. The CRCO, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') and functionally to the Group CRCO in the HSBC Group, heads the Risk and Compliance Function, which is independent from the global businesses and forms part of the second line of defence.

Day-to-day responsibility for risk management is delegated to senior managers with individual accountability for decision making. All our people have a role to play in risk management. These roles are defined using the three lines of defence model, which takes into account our business and functional structures as described in the following commentary, 'Our responsibilities'. We use a defined and consistent executive risk governance structure to help ensure there is appropriate oversight and accountability of risk, which facilitates reporting and escalation to the Risk Management Meeting.

## Risk appetite

Our risk appetite encapsulates the consideration of financial and non-financial risks. Group risk appetite is expressed in both quantitative and qualitative terms and applied at global business level, at the regional level and to the material operating entities. Our risk appetite continues to evolve and expand its scope as part of this regular review process. The Board periodically reviews and approves the group's risk appetite statement to ensure it remains fit for purpose. The risk appetite is considered, developed and enhanced through:

- -an alignment with our strategy, purpose, values, customer needs and HSBC Group Risk Appetite;
- -trends highlighted in other risk reports;
- -communication with risk stewards on the developing risk landscape;

## Our Responsibilities

All our people are responsible for identifying and managing risk within the scope of their roles. Roles are defined using the three lines of defence model, which takes into account our business and functional structures as described below.

## Three lines of defence

To create a robust control environment to manage risks, we use an activity-based three lines of defence model. This model delineates management accountabilities and responsibilities for risk management and the control environment.

The model underpins our approach to risk management by clarifying responsibility and encouraging collaboration, as well as enabling efficient coordination of risk and control activities. The three lines of defence are summarised below:

- -The first line of defence owns the risks and is responsible for identifying, recording, reporting and managing them in line with risk appetite, and ensuring that the right controls and assessments are in place to mitigate them.
- -The second line of defence challenges the first line of defence on effective risk management, and provides advice and guidance in relation to the risk.
- -The third line of defence is our Global Internal Audit function, which provides independent assurance as to whether our risk management approach and processes are designed and operating effectively.

## Risk and Compliance Function

Our Risk and Compliance function is responsible for the Group's risk management framework. This responsibility includes establishing global policy, monitoring risk profiles, and identifying and managing forward-looking risk. Risk and Compliance is made up of sub-functions covering all risks to our business. Forming part of the second line of defence, the Risk and Compliance function is independent from the global businesses, including sales and trading functions, to provide challenge, appropriate oversight and balance in risk/return decisions.

Responsibility for minimising both financial and non-financial risk lies with our people. They are required to manage the risks of the business and operational activities for which they are responsible. We maintain adequate oversight of our risks through our various specialist risk stewards and the collective accountability held by our CRCO.

We have continued to strengthen the control environment and our approach to the management of non-financial risk, as set out in our risk management framework. The management of non-financial risk focuses on governance and risk appetite, and provides a single view of the nonfinancial risks that matter the most and the associated controls. It incorporates a risk management system designed to enable the active management of non-financial risk. Our ongoing focus is on simplifying our approach to non-financial risk management, while driving more effective oversight and better end-to-end identification and management of non-financial risks. This is overseen by the Enterprise Risk Management function.

## Stress testing and recovery planning

Our stress testing programme assesses our capital and liquidity strength through rigorous examination of our resilience to external shocks. As well as undertaking regulatory-driven stress tests, we conduct our own internal stress tests in order to understand the nature and level of all material risks, quantify the impact of such risks and develop plausible mitigating actions.

We operate a wide-ranging stress testing programme that is a key part of our risk management and capital and liquidity planning. Stress testing provides management with key insights into the impact of severely adverse events on the Group and provides confidence to regulators on the Group's financial stability.

## Internal stress tests

Our internal capital assessment uses a range of stress scenarios that explore risks identified by management. They include potential adverse macroeconomic, geopolitical and operational risk events, as well as other potential events that are specific to the group and the HSBC Group.

The selection of stress scenarios is based upon the output of our identified top and emerging risks and our risk appetite. Stress testing analysis helps management understand the nature and extent of vulnerabilities to which the Region and the Group is exposed. Using this information, management decides whether risks can or should be mitigated through management actions or if they were to crystallise, be absorbed through capital and liquidity. This in turn informs decisions about preferred capital and liquidity levels and allocations.

In addition to HSBC Group wide stress testing scenarios, we conduct regular macroeconomic and event-driven scenario and analyses specific to the region and entity. We also participate, as required, in the regulatory stress testing programmes of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We also conduct reverse stress tests each year to understand potential extreme conditions that would make our business model non-viable. Reverse stress testing identifies potential stresses and vulnerabilities we might face, and helps inform early warning triggers, management actions and contingency plans designed to mitigate risks.

## Recovery and resolution plan

Recovery and resolution plans form part of the integral framework safeguarding the group's financial stability. The recovery plan together with stress testing help us understand the likely outcomes of adverse business or economic conditions and in the identification of appropriate risk mitigating action. The group is committed to further developing its recovery and resolution capabilities in line with applicable local regulatory resolvability assessment framework requirements.

The group will continue to enhance its recovery and resolution plan in line with the requirements of the DFSA.

## Key developments in 2024

We continued to actively manage the risks related to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, as well as other key risks described in this section. In addition, we sought to enhance our risk management in the following areas:

- -We enhanced our management of concentration risk at country and single customer group levels by implementing new frameworks to strengthen our control of risk appetite.
- -We enhanced our processes, framework and reporting capabilities to improve the control and oversight of our material third parties, to help maintain our operational resilience and meet new and evolving regulatory requirements.
- -We continued to make progress with our comprehensive regulatory reporting programme to strengthen our global processes, improve consistency and enhance controls.
- -Through our climate risk programme, we continued to embed climate considerations, including through implementation of climate-related risk policies and processes along with regional inputs towards the annual climate risk materiality assessment across the Group. We continue to implement our climate risk programme to improve our processes and capabilities to better embed climate considerations throughout our organization.
- -We deployed industry-leading technology and advanced analytics capabilities into new markets to improve our ability to identify suspicious activities and prevent financial crime.
- -We continued to develop and enhance our electronic communication policies and standards to help enable escalations and follow-up actions which are focused on our most substantive issues. A group-wide approach on Corporate Device availability is being implemented in order to meet regulatory expectations.
- -We are embedding our regulatory management ecosystem following the bank-wide rollout of regulatory horizon scanning capabilities and enhanced regulation mapping tooling.

## Top and emerging risks

We use a top and emerging risks process to provide a forward-looking view of issues with the potential to threaten the execution of our strategy or operations over the medium to long term. We proactively assess the internal and external risk environment and our top and emerging risks as necessary.

Our current top and emerging risks are described on page 72.

## Credit risk

## Credit risk management

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. It arises principally from direct lending, trade finance and leasing business, but also from other products such as guarantees and credit derivatives. Credit risk generates the largest regulatory capital requirement of the risks the group incurs.

We have implemented HSBC Group wide credit risk management and related IFRS 9 processes. We continue to assess actively the impact of economic developments in key markets on specific customers, customer segments or portfolios. As credit conditions change, we take mitigating action, including the revision of risk appetites or limits and tenors, as appropriate. In addition, we continue to evaluate the terms under which we provide credit facilities within the context of individual customer requirements, the quality of the relationship, local regulatory requirements, market practices and our local market position.

Credit approval authorities are delegated by the Board to the CEO and with the authority to sub-delegate them. The Credit Risk sub-function reports to the CRCO and is responsible for key policies and processes for managing credit risk, which include formulating credit policies and risk rating frameworks, guiding the group's appetite for credit risk exposures, undertaking independent reviews and objective assessment of credit risk, and monitoring performance and management of portfolios.

The principal objectives of our credit risk management are:

- -To maintain a strong culture of responsible lending, and robust risk policies and control frameworks;
- -To both partner and challenge our business in defining, implementing and continually re-evaluating our risk appetite under actual and scenario conditions; and
- -To ensure there is independent, expert scrutiny of credit risk, their costs and their mitigation.

## IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' Process

We have established IFRS 9 modelling and data processes which are subject to internal model risk governance including independent review of significant model developments. A centralised impairment engine performs the expected credit loss ('ECL') calculation using data, which is subject to a number of validation checks and enhancements, from a variety of client, finance and risk systems. Where possible, these checks and processes are performed in a globally consistent and centralised manner. A group review forum with representatives from Credit Risk and Finance has been established to review and approve the impairment results.

## Concentration of exposure

Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of counterparties or exposures have comparable economic characteristics, or such counterparties are engaged in similar activities or operate in the same geographical areas or industry sectors so that their collective ability to meet contractual obligations is uniformly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. We use a number of controls and

measures to minimise undue concentration of exposure in our portfolios across industries, countries and global businesses. These include portfolio and counterparty limits, approval and review controls and stress testing.

Wrong-way risk is an aggravated form of concentration risk and arises when there is a strong correlation between the counterparty's probability of default and the mark-to-market value of the underlying transaction. The group uses a range of procedures to monitor and control wrong-way risk, including requiring entities to obtain prior approval before undertaking wrong-way risk transactions outside pre-agreed guidelines.

Further details on gross loans and advances to customers by industry sector are set out on page 61.

## Credit quality of financial instruments

The group's credit risk rating systems and processes differentiate exposures in order to highlight those with greater risk factors and higher potential severity of loss. In the case of individually significant accounts, risk ratings are reviewed regularly and any amendments are implemented promptly. Within the group's retail business, risk is assessed and managed using a wide range of risk and pricing models to generate portfolio data.

Special attention is paid to problem exposures in order to accelerate remedial action. Where appropriate, the group uses specialist units to provide customers with support in order to help them avoid default wherever possible.

Periodic risk-based audits of the group's credit processes and portfolios are also undertaken by an independent function.

## Impairment assessment

For details of impairment policies on loans and advances and financial investments, see Note 2.2(i) on the Financial Statements.

## Write-off of loans and advances

Loans are normally written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of further recovery. For secured loans, write-off generally occurs after receipt of any proceeds from the realisation of security.

Unsecured personal facilities, including credit cards, are generally written off at between 150 and 210 days past due, the standard period being the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days contractually delinquent. However, in exceptional circumstances, they may be extended further, in countries where local regulation or legislation constrain earlier write-off, or where the realisation of collateral for secured real estate lending extends to this time.

In the event of bankruptcy or analogous proceedings, write-off may occur earlier than at the periods stated above. Collections procedures may continue after write-off.

## Summary of credit risk

The disclosure below presents the gross carrying/nominal amount of financial instruments to which the impairment requirements in IFRS 9 are applied and the associated allowance for ECL.

The IFRS 9 allowance for ECL has decreased from US$706m at 31 December 2023 to US$584m at 31 December 2024.

The IFRS 9 allowance for ECL at 31 December 2024 comprises US$566m (2023: US$694m) in respect of assets held at amortised cost, US$1m (2023: US$3m) on debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and US$17m (2023: US$9m) in respect of loan commitments and financial guarantees.

The following table provides an overview of the group's credit risk by stage, and the associated ECL coverage. The financial assets recorded in each stage have the following characteristics:

Stage 1: Unimpaired and without significant increase in credit risk on which a 12-month allowance for ECL is recognised.

Stage 2: A significant increase in credit risk has been experienced since initial recognition on which a lifetime ECL is recognised.

Stage 3: Objective evidence of impairment and are therefore considered to be in default or otherwise credit-impaired on which a lifetime ECL is recognised.

POCI: Purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses on which a lifetime ECL is recognised.

## Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates

Expected credit loss impairment allowances recognised in the financial statements reflect the effect of a range of possible economic outcomes, calculated on a probability-weighted basis, based on the economic scenarios described below. The recognition and measurement of ECL involves the use of significant judgement and estimation. It is necessary to formulate multiple economic scenarios based on economic forecasts, apply these assumptions to credit risk models to estimate future credit losses and probability weight the results to determine an unbiased ECL estimate. The group uses a standard framework to form economic scenarios to reflect assumptions about future economic conditions, supplemented with the use of management judgement, which may result in using alternative or additional economic scenarios and/ or management adjustments.

## Methodology for Developing Forward Looking Economic Scenarios

The group has adopted four global economic scenarios which are used to capture the current economic environment and to articulate management's view of the range of potential outcomes. Scenarios produced to calculate ECL are aligned to our top and emerging risks.

Three of the scenarios are drawn from consensus forecasts and distributional estimates. The Central scenario is deemed the 'most likely' scenario, and usually attracts the largest probability weighting, while the outer scenarios represent the tails of the distribution, which are less likely to occur. The Central scenario is created using the average of a panel of external forecasters. Consensus Upside and Downside scenarios are created with reference to forecast probability distributions for select markets that capture views of the entire range of economic outcomes. In the later years of the scenarios, projections revert to long-term consensus trend expectations. In the consensus outer scenarios, reversion to trend expectations is done mechanically with reference to historically observed quarterly changes in the values of macroeconomic variables.

The fourth scenario, Downside 2, is designed to represent management's view of severe downside risks. It is a globally consistent narrativedriven scenario that explores more extreme economic outcomes than those captured by the consensus scenarios. In this scenario, variables do not, by design, revert to long-term trend expectations. They may instead explore alternative states of equilibrium, where economic activity moves permanently away from past trends. The consensus Downside and the consensus Upside scenarios are each constructed to be consistent with a 10% probability. The Downside 2 is constructed with a 5% probability. The Central scenario is assigned the remaining 75%. This weighting scheme is deemed appropriate for the unbiased estimation of ECL in most circumstances. However, management may depart from this probability-based scenario weighting approach when the economic outlook is determined to be particularly uncertain and risks are elevated.

## Economic scenarios sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates

The ECL outcome is sensitive to judgement and estimations made with regards to the formulation and incorporation of multiple forward looking economic conditions described above. As a result, management assessed and considered the sensitivity of the ECL outcome against the forward looking economic conditions as part of the ECL governance process by recalculating the ECL under each scenario described above for selected portfolios, applying a 100% weighting to each scenario in turn. The weighting is reflected in both the determination of significant increase in credit risk as well as the measurement of the resulting ECL.

The economic scenarios are generated to capture the group's view of a range of possible forecast economic conditions that is sufficient for the calculation of unbiased and probability-weighted ECL. As a result, the ECL calculated for the upside and downside scenarios should not be taken to represent the upper and lower limits of possible actual ECL outcomes. There are a very wide range of possible combinations of interrelated economic factors that could influence actual credit loss outcomes, accordingly the range of estimates provided by attributing 100% weightings to scenarios are indicative of possible outcomes given the assumptions used. A wider range of possible ECL outcomes reflects uncertainty about the distribution of economic conditions and does not necessarily mean that credit risk on the associated loans is higher than for loans where the distribution of possible future economic conditions is narrower. The recalculated ECLs for each of the scenarios should be read in the context of the sensitivity analysis as a whole and in conjunction with the narrative disclosures.

## How economic scenarios are reflected in the wholesale calculation of ECL

HSBC has developed a globally consistent methodology for the application of forward economic guidance into the calculation of ECL by incorporating these scenarios into the estimation of the term structure of probability of default ('PD'), loss given default ('LGD') and through the exposure at default ('EAD') for the UAE.

For PDs, we consider the correlation of forward economic guidance to default rates. For LGD calculations, we consider the correlation of forward economic guidance to loss amounts of defaulted customers. For EAD calculations, we consider the correlation of forward economic guidance to potential utilization.

For impaired loans, ECL estimates take into account independent recovery valuations provided by external consultants where available, or internal forecasts corresponding to anticipated economic conditions and individual company conditions. In estimating the ECL on impaired loans that are individually considered not to be significant, HSBC incorporates forward economic guidance proportionate to the probability-weighted outcome and the central scenario outcome for non-stage 3 populations.

1 Excludes ECL and financial instruments relating to defaulted obligors because the measurement of ECL is relatively more sensitive to credit factors specific to the obligor than future economic scenarios.

2 Includes off-balance sheet financial instruments that are subject to significant measurement uncertainty.

3 Includes low credit-risk financial instruments such as debt instruments at FVOCI, which have high carrying amounts but low ECL under all the above scenarios.

## How economic scenarios are reflected in the retail calculation of ECL

The group has adopted a globally consistent methodology for incorporating forecasts of economic conditions into ECL estimates. The impact of economic scenarios on PD is modelled at a portfolio level. Historical relationships between observed default rates and macro-economic variables are integrated into IFRS 9 ECL estimates by using economic response models. The impact of these scenarios on PD is modelled over a period aligned to the remaining maturity of underlying asset or assets.

For LGD, the impact is modelled for mortgage portfolios by forecasting future loan-to-value profiles for the remaining maturity of the asset, using national level house price index forecasts and applying the corresponding LGD expectation relative to the updated forecast collateral values.

## Reconciliation of changes in gross carrying/nominal amount and allowances for loans and advances to banks and customers including loan commitments and financial guarantees

The following disclosure provides a reconciliation by stage of the group's gross carrying/nominal amount and allowances for loans and advances to banks and customers, including loan commitments and financial guarantees. Movements are calculated on a quarterly basis and therefore fully capture stage movements between quarters. If movements were calculated on a year-to-date basis they would only reflect the opening and closing position of the financial instrument. The transfers of financial instruments represents the impact of stage transfers upon the gross carrying/nominal amount and associated allowance for ECL.

The net remeasurement of ECL arising from stage transfers represents the increase or decrease due to these transfers, for example, moving from a 12-month (stage 1) to a lifetime (stage 2) ECL measurement basis. Net remeasurement excludes the underlying CRR/PD movements of the financial instruments from stage transfers. This is captured, along with other credit quality movements in the 'Changes to risk parameters further lending/repayments (including changes in credit quality and model used)' line item. This line also includes changes due to volume movements within the group's lending portfolio.

The contractual amount outstanding on financial assets that were written off during the year ended 31 December 2024 and that are still subject to enforcement activity is $137m.

As shown in the previous table, the allowance for ECL for loans and advances to customers and banks and relevant loan commitments and financial guarantees decreased by $117m during the year from $698m at 31 December 2023 to $561m at 31 December 2024.

This decrease was primarily driven by:

- -US$177m of assets written off; and
- -US$58m due to assets derecognised.

These were partly offset by:

- -US$88m relating to changes in risk parameters; and
- -US$17m relating to new financial assets originated or purchased.

The ECL charge of $47m for the period presented in the previous table consist of $47m charge relating to underlying credit quality changes, including the credit quality impact of financial instruments transferring between stages.

## Credit quality of financial instruments

The group assesses the credit quality of all financial instruments that are subject to credit risk. The credit quality of financial instruments is a point-in-time assessment of PD, whereas stages 1 and 2 are determined based on relative deterioration of credit quality since initial recognition. Accordingly, for non-credit-impaired financial instruments, there is no direct relationship between the credit quality assessment and stages 1 and 2, although typically the lower credit quality bands exhibit a higher proportion in stage 2.

The five credit quality classifications defined below each encompass a range of granular internal credit rating grades assigned to wholesale and personal lending businesses and the external ratings attributed by external agencies to debt securities.

## Credit quality classification

|                        | Debt securities and other bills   | Wholesale lending      | Retail lending         | Retail lending         | Retail lending   |

| Satisfactory           | BB+ to B and unrated              | CRR4 to CRR5           | Band 4 and 5           | 1.501–20.000           | <nl>             |
| Sub-standard           | B– to C                           | CRR6 to CRR8           | Band 6                 | 20.001–99.999          | <nl>             |

1 Customer risk rating.

2 12-month point-in-time probability weighted probability of default ('PD').

## Quality classification definitions

- 'Strong' exposures demonstrate a strong capacity to meet financial commitments, with negligible or low PD and/or low levels of expected loss.
- 'Good' exposures require closer monitoring and demonstrate a good capacity to meet financial commitments, with low default risk.
- 'Satisfactory' exposures require closer monitoring and demonstrate an average to fair capacity to meet financial commitments, with moderate default risk.
- 'Sub-standard' exposures require varying degrees of special attention and default risk is of greater concern.
- 'Impaired' exposures have been assessed as impaired. These also include retail accounts classified as Band 1 to Band 6 that are delinquent by more than 90 days, unless individually they have been assessed as not impaired; and renegotiated loans that have met the requirements to be disclosed as impaired and have not yet met the criteria to be returned to the unimpaired portfolio.

## Risk rating scales

The CRR 10-grade scale summarises a more granular underlying 23-grade scale of obligor PD. All the group customers are rated using the 10or 23-grade scale, depending on the degree of sophistication of the Basel approach adopted for the exposure.

Retail lending credit quality is disclosed based on a 12-month point-in-time probability weighted PD.

For debt securities and certain other financial instruments, external ratings have been aligned to the five quality classifications. The ratings of Standard and Poor's are cited, with those of other agencies being treated equivalently. Debt securities with short-term issue ratings are reported against the long-term rating of the issuer of those securities. If major rating agencies have different ratings for the same debt securities, a prudent rating selection is made in line with regulatory requirements.

1 For the purposes of this disclosure, gross carrying value is defined as the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance. As such, the gross carrying value of debt instruments at FVOCI as presented above will not reconcile to the balance sheet as it excludes fair value gains and losses.

## Past due but not impaired gross financial instruments

Past due but not impaired gross financial instruments are those loans where, although customers have failed to make payments in accordance with the contractual terms of their facilities, they have not met the impaired loan criteria. This is typically when a loan is less than 90 days past due and there are no other indicators of impairment.

Exposures past due but not impaired also include individually assessed mortgages that are in arrears more than 90 days, but there are no other indicators of impairment and the value of collateral is sufficient to repay both the principal debt and all potential interest for at least one year or short-term trade facilities past due more than 90 days for technical reasons such as delays in documentation but there is no concern over the creditworthiness of the counterparty.

The following table provides an analysis of gross loans and advances to customers held at amortised cost which are past due but not considered impaired. There are no other significant balance sheet items where past due balances are not considered impaired.

## Credit-impaired loans

We determine that a financial instrument is credit impaired and in stage 3 by considering relevant objective evidence, primarily whether:

- -contractual payments of either principal or interest are past due for more than 90 days;
- -there are other indications that the borrower is unlikely to pay, such as when a concession has been granted to the borrower for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial condition; and
- -the loan is otherwise considered to be in default. If such unlikeliness to pay is not identified at an earlier stage, it is deemed to occur when an exposure is 90 days past due.

## Forborne loans and advances

Forbearance measures consist of concessions towards an obligor that is experiencing or about to experience difficulties in meeting its financial commitments.

We continue to class loans as forborne when we modify the contractual payment terms due to having significant concerns about the borrowers' ability to meet contractual payments when they were due.

## Credit quality of forborne loans

For wholesale lending, where payment-related forbearance measures result in a diminished financial obligation, or if there are other indicators of impairment, the loan will be classified as credit impaired if it is not already so classified. All facilities with a customer, including loans that have not been modified, are considered credit impaired following the identification of a payment-related forborne loan.

For retail lending, where a material payment-related concession has been granted, the loan will be classified as credit impaired. In isolation, nonpayment forbearance measures may not result in the loan being classified as credit impaired unless combined with other indicators of credit impairment. These are classed as performing forborne loans for both wholesale and retail lending.

Wholesale and retail lending forborne loans are classified as credit impaired until there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of non-payment of future cash flows, observed over a minimum one-year period, and there are no other indicators of impairment. Any forborne loans not considered credit impaired will remain forborne for a minimum of two years from the date that credit impairment no longer applies. For wholesale and retail lending, any forbearance measures granted on a loan already classed as forborne results in the customer being classed as credit impaired.

## Forborne loans and recognition of expected credit losses

Forborne loans expected credit loss assessments reflect the higher rates of losses typically experienced with these types of loans such that they are in stage 2 and stage 3. The higher rates are more pronounced in unsecured retail lending requiring further segmentation. For wholesale lending, forborne loans are typically assessed individually. Credit risk ratings are intrinsic to the impairment assessments. The individual impairment assessment takes into account the higher risk of the future non-payment inherent in forborne loans.

## Collateral and other credit enhancements held

## Loans and advances held at amortised cost

Although collateral can be an important mitigant of credit risk, it is the group's practice to lend on the basis of the customer's ability to meet their obligations out of cash flow resources rather than rely on the value of security offered. Depending on the customer's standing and the type of product, facilities may be provided without security. However, for other lending a charge over collateral is obtained and considered in determining the credit decision and pricing. In the event of default, the group may utilise the collateral as a source of repayment. Depending on its form, collateral can have a significant financial effect in mitigating the group's exposure to credit risk.

The tables below provide a quantification of the value of fixed charges the group holds over a specific asset (or assets) where the group has a history of enforcing, and is able to enforce, the collateral in satisfying a debt in the event of the borrower failing to meet its contractual obligations, and where the collateral is cash or can be realised by sale in an established market. The collateral valuation in the tables below excludes any adjustments for obtaining and selling the collateral.

The group may also manage its risk by employing other types of collateral and credit risk enhancements, such as second charges, other liens and unsupported guarantees, but the valuation of such mitigants is less certain and their financial effect has not been quantified. In particular, loans shown in the tables below as not collateralised or partially collateralised may benefit from such credit mitigants.

The above table shows residential mortgage lending including off-balance sheet loan commitments by level of collateral. The collateral included in the table above consists of first charges on real estate.

The LTV ratio is calculated as the gross on balance sheet carrying amount of the loan and any off-balance sheet loan commitment at the balance sheet date divided by the value of collateral. The methodologies for obtaining residential property collateral values vary, but are typically determined through a combination of professional appraisals, house price indices or statistical analysis. Valuations must be updated on a regular basis and, as a minimum, at intervals of every three years.

## Other personal lending

The other personal lending consists primarily of motor vehicle, credit cards, personal loans, margin lending and overdrafts. Motor vehicle lending is generally collateralised by the motor vehicle financed and margin lending is backed by the relevant marketable security. Credit cards, personal loans and overdrafts are unsecured.

## Collateral on loans and advances

Commercial real estate loans and advances

Collateral held is analysed separately below for commercial real estate and for other corporate, commercial and financial (non-bank) lending. The analysis includes off-balance sheet loan commitments, primarily undrawn credit lines.

The collateral included in the table above consists of fixed first charges on real estate and charges over cash for commercial real estate. Above facilities are disclosed as not collateralised if they are unsecured or benefit from credit risk mitigation from guarantees, which are not quantified for the purposes of this disclosure.

The value of commercial real estate collateral is determined through a combination of professional and internal valuations and physical inspection. Due to the complexity of valuing collateral for commercial real estate, local valuation policies determine the frequency of review based on local market conditions. Revaluations are sought with greater frequency when, as part of the regular credit assessment of the obligor, material concerns arise in relation to the transaction which may reflect on the underlying performance of the collateral, or in circumstances

where an obligor's credit quality has declined sufficiently to cause concern that the principal payment source may not fully meet the obligation (i.e. the obligor's credit quality classification indicates it is at the lower end, that is sub-standard, or approaching impaired). Where such concerns exist the revaluation method selected will depend upon the loan-to-value relationship, the direction in which the local commercial real estate market has moved since the last valuation and, most importantly, the specific characteristics of the underlying commercial real estate which is of concern.

Other corporate, commercial and financial (non-bank) lending is analysed separately below reflecting the difference in collateral held on the portfolios. For financing activities in corporate and commercial lending that are not predominantly commercial real estate-oriented, collateral value is not strongly correlated to principal repayment performance. Collateral values are generally refreshed when an obligor's general credit performance deteriorates and we have to assess the likely performance of secondary sources of repayment should it prove necessary to rely on them.

## Other credit risk exposures

In addition to collateralised lending described above, other credit enhancements are employed and methods used to mitigate credit risk arising from financial assets. These are described in more detail below:

- Securities issued by governments, banks and other financial institutions may benefit from additional credit enhancement, notably through government guarantees that reference these assets.

The group's maximum exposure to credit risk includes financial guarantees and similar arrangements that the group issues or enters into, and loan commitments that the group are irrevocably committed to. Depending on the terms of the arrangement, the group may have recourse to additional credit mitigation in the event that a guarantee is called upon or a loan commitment is drawn and subsequently defaults.

## Derivatives

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ('ISDA') Master Agreement is our preferred agreement for documenting derivatives activity. It provides the contractual framework within which dealing activity across a full range of over-the-counter ('OTC') products is conducted, and contractually binds both parties to apply close-out netting across all outstanding transactions covered by an agreement if either party defaults or another pre-agreed termination event occurs. It is common, and our preferred practice, for the parties to execute a Credit Support Annex ('CSA') in conjunction with the ISDA Master Agreement. Under a CSA, collateral is passed between the parties to mitigate the counterparty risk inherent in outstanding positions.

## Treasury Risk

## Overview

Treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements. Treasury risk also includes the risk to our earnings or capital due to structural and transactional foreign exchange exposures and changes in market interest rates, together with pension and insurance risk.

Treasury risk arises from changes to the respective resources and risk profiles driven by customer behaviour, management decisions or the external environment.

## Approach and policy

Our objective in the management of treasury risk is to maintain appropriate levels of capital, liquidity, funding, foreign exchange and market risk to support our business strategy, and meet our regulatory and stress testing-related requirements. Our approach to treasury management is driven by our strategic and organisational requirements and considers the regulatory, economic and commercial environment. We aim to maintain a strong capital and liquidity base to support the risks inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our strategy, meeting both consolidated and local regulatory requirements at all times.

Our policy is underpinned by our risk management framework, our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ('ICAAP') and our Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process ('ILAAP'). The risk management framework incorporates a number of measures aligned to our assessment of risks for both internal and regulatory purposes. These risks include credit, market, operational, structural and transactional foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk in the banking book.

## Governance and structure

The Group Head of Traded and Treasury Risk Management is the accountable risk steward for all treasury risks. The Group Treasurer is the risk owner for all treasury risks, with the exception of pension risk and insurance risk.

Capital risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, structural foreign exchange risk and transactional foreign exchange risk are the responsibility of the Risk Committee ('RC'). The Treasury function actively manages these risks on an ongoing basis, supported by the Asset and Liability Management Committee ('ALCO'), overseen by Treasury Risk Management and the Risk Management Meeting ('RMM').

## Assessment and risk appetite

Our capital management approach is underpinned by a global capital risk policy and our ICAAP. The policy incorporates key capital risk appetites for CET1, total capital and leverage ratio. The ICAAP is an assessment of our capital position, outlining both regulatory and internal capital resources and requirements resulting from our business model, strategy, risk profile and management, performance and planning, risks to capital, and the implications of stress testing. Our assessment of capital adequacy is driven by an assessment of risks. These risks include credit, market, operational, structural foreign exchange, interest rate risk in the banking book and credit concentration risk. Climate risk is also considered as part of the ICAAP and we are continuing to develop our approach. The ICAAP supports the determination of the consolidated capital risk appetite and target ratios, as well as enables the assessment and determination of capital requirements by regulators.

We aim to ensure that management has oversight of our liquidity and funding risks at Group and entity level through robust governance, in line with our risk management framework. We manage liquidity and funding risk at an operating entity level in accordance with consistent policies, procedures and reporting standards. This ensures that obligations can be met in a timely manner, in the jurisdiction where they fall due. Operating entities are required to meet internal minimum requirements and any applicable regulatory requirements at all times.

These requirements are assessed through the ILAAP, which ensures that operating entities have robust strategies, policies, processes and systems for the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of liquidity risk over an appropriate set of time horizons, additionally an intraday add on is incorporated. The ILAAP informs the setting of risk appetite. It also assesses the capability to manage liquidity and funding effectively. These metrics are set and managed locally but are subject to robust review and challenge to ensure consistency of approach and application of the Group's policies and controls.

Interest rate risk in the banking book is the risk of an adverse impact to earnings or capital due to changes in market interest rates or changes in expected interest rate repricing of client products that impacts banking book positions. It is generated by our non-traded assets and liabilities, specifically loans, deposits and financial instruments that are not held for trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent.

Our IRRB risk management framework is designed to ensure that all material sources of IRRB are identified, measured, managed, and monitored, with robust policies and frameworks in place.

Our IRRB risks are measured and managed using a combination of economic value and earnings-based measures to ensure that the balance between stabilising earnings and generating value sensitivity is managed appropriately. These metrics measure IRRB risks across the banking book, to support the overall monitoring against risk appetite, including:

- -Banking net interest income ('BNII') sensitivity; and
- -Economic value of equity ('EVE') sensitivity.

## Banking net interest income sensitivity

BNII sensitivity captures the risk to earnings generated from the banking book from changes in market implied interest rates over a 12-month period using static rolling balance sheet assumptions.

The static rolling balance sheet assumption is in place to ensure that IRRB management actions are focused on risks which can be managed within Treasury. A notable exception to this is related to the price sensitivity of certain interest bearing non-maturity deposits, where we apply dynamic assumptions to ensure we capture any potential margin widening or compression over the corresponding shock horizon and rate scenario.

As at 31 December 2024, the sensitivity of our earnings to an immediate 100bps parallel shock to interest rates is US$126m (2023: US$119m) for an upwards shock and US$134m (2023: US$151m) for a downwards shock. This assessment is based on a static balance sheet, no management actions from Treasury, and a 50% pass-on assumption on certain interest-bearing deposits.

## Economic value of equity sensitivity

EVE measures the present value of our banking book assets and liabilities excluding equity, based on a run-off balance sheet. EVE sensitivity measures the impact to EVE from a movement in interest rates, including the assumed term profile of non-maturing deposits having adjusted for stability and price sensitivity. It is measured and reported as part of our internal risk metrics and regulatory rules (including the Supervisory Outlier Test).

## Stress testing and recovery planning

We use stress testing to evaluate the robustness of plans and risk portfolios. Stress testing also informs the ICAAP and ILAAP and supports recovery planning. It is an important output used to evaluate how much capital and liquidity we require in setting risk appetite for capital and liquidity risk. It is also used to re-evaluate business plans where analysis shows capital, liquidity and/or returns do not meet their target.We maintain a recovery plan addressing the actions that management would consider taking in a stress scenario if the position deteriorates and threatens to breach risk appetite and regulatory minimum levels. The recovery plan sets out a range of appropriate actions which could feasibly be executed in a stressed environment to recover the position.

## Risks to capital and liquidity

Outside the stress testing framework, other risks may be identified that have the potential to affect our RWAs, capital and/or liquidity position. Downside and upside scenarios are assessed against our management objectives, and mitigating actions are assigned as necessary. We closely monitor future regulatory developments and continue to evaluate the impact of these upon our capital and liquidity requirements.

## Liquidity and Funding

## Overview

At 31 December 2024, we were above regulatory minimum liquidity and funding levels. We maintain sufficient unencumbered liquid assets to comply with local and regulatory requirements. We further consider an internal liquidity metric, which is being used to monitor and manage liquidity risk via a low-point measure across a 270-day horizon, taking into account recovery capacity.

## Management of Liquidity and Funding Risk

## Liquidity coverage ratio ('LCR')

The LCR aims to ensure that a bank has sufficient unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs in a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. For the calculation of the LCR, HSBC Group follows the guidelines set by the European Commission. At a group level we follow the Dubai Financial Services Authority ('DESA') approach and additionally at an operating entity level we follow the group guidelines.

## Net stable funding ratio ('NSFR')

HSBC Group's internal liquidity and funding risk management framework requires all entities to use the net stable funding ratio ('NSFR') as a basis for ensuring operating entities raise sufficient stable funding to support their business activities. The NSFR requires institutions to maintain minimum amount of stable funding based on assumptions of asset liquidity together with any locally applicable requirements.

## Depositor concentration and wholesale market term funding maturity concentration

The LCR and NSFR metrics assume a stressed outflow based on a portfolio of depositors within each deposit segment. The validity of these assumptions is challenged if the portfolio of depositors is not large enough to avoid depositor concentration. Operating entities are exposed to term re-financing concentration risk if the current maturity profile results in future maturities being overly concentrated in any defined period.

The group monitors depositor concentration and term funding maturity concentration. Both metrics are subject to limits.

## Liquid assets

Liquid assets are held and managed on a stand-alone operating entity basis. Most are held primarily by the Markets Treasury function for the purpose of managing liquidity risk in line with the internal policy. Liquid assets include all unencumbered liquidity assets in compliance with internal and regulatory requirements.

Further details in respect of the group's Liquidity and Funding ratios are set out on page 73.

## Primary sources of funding

Our primary sources of funding are customer current accounts and savings deposits payable on demand or at short notice. We issue unsecured wholesale securities to supplement customer deposits and to change the currency mix, maturity profile or location of our liabilities.

Ordinary share capital and retained reserves, non-core capital instruments and intergroup borrowings are also a source of stable funding.

Customer deposits in the form of current accounts and savings deposits payable on demand or at short notice form a significant part of our funding, and the group places considerable importance on maintaining their stability. For deposits, stability depends upon maintaining depositor confidence in our capital strength and liquidity, and on competitive and transparent pricing.

Of total liabilities of US$51,863m at 31 December 2024, funding from customers amounted to US$34,828m, of which US$34,506m was contractually repayable within one year.

An analysis of cash flows payable by the group under financial liabilities by remaining contractual maturities at the balance sheet date is included in Note 27.

Assets available to meet these liabilities, and to cover outstanding commitments to lend (US$24,134m), included cash, central bank balances, items in the course of collection and financial investment with maturity of less than one year (US$4,458m); loans to banks (US$11,682m, including US$11,059m repayable within one year); and loans to customers (US$20,440m, including US$8,416m repayable within one year). In the normal course of business, a proportion of customer loans contractually repayable within one year will be extended.

## Market risk

## Market risk management

Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios.

The group's exposure to market risk is separated into trading or non-trading portfolios. Trading portfolios comprise positions arising from market-making and warehousing of customer-derived positions. Non-trading portfolios include positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of the group's retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments designated as fair value through other comprehensive income.

## Market risk measures

## Monitoring and limiting market risk exposures

The group's objective is to manage and control market risk exposures while maintaining a market profile consistent with the group's risk appetite. The group uses a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk exposures, including:

- -sensitivity measures include sensitivity of net interest income and sensitivity for structural foreign exchange, which are used to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type;
- -value at risk ('VaR') is a technique that estimates the potential losses that could occur on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence; and

- -in recognition of VaR's limitations the group augments VaR with stress testing to evaluate the potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme, though plausible, events or movements in a set of financial variables.

Market risk is managed and controlled through limits approved by the Risk Management Meeting for HSBC Holdings and our various global businesses. These limits are allocated across business lines and to the HSBC Group's legal entities.

The management of market risk is principally undertaken in Markets and Security Services ('MSS'). VaR limits are set for portfolios, business line, products and risk types, with market liquidity being a primary factor in determining the level of limits set.

HSBC Group Risk, an independent unit within HSBC Group, is responsible for our market risk management policies and measurement techniques. The group has an independent market risk management and control function that is responsible for measuring market risk exposures in accordance with the policies defined by HSBC Group Risk, and monitoring and reporting these exposures against the prescribed limits on a daily basis. The group assesses the market risks arising on each product in its business and to transfer them to either its MSS unit for management, or to separate books managed under the supervision of the local ALCO. Our aim is to ensure that all market risks are consolidated within operations that have the necessary skills, tools, management and governance to manage them professionally. In certain cases where the market risks cannot be fully transferred, the group identifies the impact of varying scenarios on valuations or on net interest income resulting from any residual risk positions.

## Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market factor movements on specific instruments or portfolios, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices, such as the effect of a one basis point change in yield. We use sensitivity measures to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type. Sensitivity limits are set for portfolios, products and risk types, with the depth of the market being one of the principal factors in determining the level of limits set.

## Value at risk

The VaR models used by the group are predominantly based on historical simulation. These models derive plausible future scenarios from past series of recorded market rates and prices, taking into account inter-relationships between different markets and rates, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The models also incorporate the effect of option features on the underlying exposures. The historical simulation models assess potential market movements with reference to data from the past two years and calculate VaR to a 99% confidence level and for a one-day holding period.

The group routinely validates the accuracy of its VaR models by back-testing the actual daily profit and loss results, adjusted to remove nonmodelled items such as fees and commissions, against the corresponding VAR numbers. Statistically, the group would expect to see losses in excess of VaR only 1% of the time over a one-year period. The actual number of excesses over this period can therefore be used to gauge how well the models are performing.

Although a valuable guide to risk, VaR should always be viewed in the context of its limitations:

- -the use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future events may not encompass all potential events, particularly those which are extreme in nature;
- -the use of a one-day holding period assumes that all positions can be liquidated or the risks offset in one day. This may not fully reflect the market risk arising at times of severe illiquidity, when a one-day holding period may be insufficient to liquidate or hedge all positions fully;
- -the use of a 99% confidence level, by definition, does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence;
- -VaR is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and therefore does not necessarily reflect intra-day exposures; and
- -VaR is unlikely to reflect loss potential on exposures that only arise under conditions of significant market movement.

## Trading portfolios

The group's control of market risk in the trading portfolios is based on a policy of restricting individual operations to trading within a list of permissible instruments authorised for each site by HSBC Group Risk, of enforcing new product approval procedures, and of restricting trading in the more complex derivative products only to offices with appropriate levels of product expertise and robust control systems.

Market-making and position-taking is undertaken within MSS. The VaR for such trading intent activity at 31 December 2024 was US$3.2m (2023: US$4.8m).

1 The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects.

## Non- trading portfolios

The principal objective of market risk management of non-trading portfolios is to optimise net interest income.

Interest rate risk in non-trading portfolios arises principally from mismatches between the future yield on assets and their funding cost as a result of interest rate changes. Analysis of this risk is complicated by having to make assumptions on embedded optionality within certain product areas, such as the incidence of mortgage prepayments, and from behavioural assumptions regarding the economic duration of liabilities which are contractually repayable on demand such as current accounts, and the re-pricing behaviour of managed rate products.

The control of market risk in the non-trading portfolios is based on transferring the risks to the books managed by MSS and Markets Treasury ('MKTY') or the local ALCO. The net exposure is typically managed through the use of interest rate swaps within agreed limits. The VaR for these portfolios is included within the group VaR.

## Gap risk

A gap event is a significant and sudden change in market price with no accompanying trading opportunity. Such movements may occur, for example, when, in reaction to an adverse event or unexpected news announcement, some parts of the market move far beyond their normal volatility range and become temporarily illiquid.

Given the characteristics, these transactions will not have significant impact on VaR or to market risk sensitivity measures. The group captures the risks for such transactions within the stress testing scenarios and monitors gap risk on an ongoing basis.

The group incurred no material losses (2023: nil) arising from gap risk movements in the underlying market price on such transactions in the 12 months ended 31 December 2024.

## De-peg risk

For certain currencies (pegged or managed) the spot exchange rate is pegged at a fixed rate (typically to USD), or managed within a predefined band around a pegged rate. De-peg risk is the risk of the peg or managed band changing or being abolished, and moving to a floating regime.

Using stressed scenarios on spot rates, the group is able to analyse how de-peg events would impact the positions held by the group. This complements traditional market risk metrics, such as historical VaR, which may not fully capture the risk involved in holding positions in pegged currencies. Historical VaR relies on past events to determine the likelihood of potential profits or losses. However, pegged or managed currencies may not have experienced a de-peg event during the historical timeframe being considered.

## Structural foreign exchange exposures

Structural foreign exchange exposures represent net investments in subsidiaries, branches or associates, the functional currencies of which are currencies other than the US dollar. An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.

Exchange differences on structural exposures are recorded in 'Other comprehensive income'. The main operating currencies of the group are UAE dirham and other Gulf currencies that are linked to the US dollar.

The group's policy is to hedge structural foreign currency exposures only in limited circumstances. The group's structural foreign exchange exposures are managed with the primary objective of ensuring, where practical, that the group's capital ratio is protected from the effect of changes in exchange rates. This is usually achieved by ensuring that the rates of structural exposures in a given currency to risk-weighted assets denominated in that currency is broadly equal to the capital ratio. The group considers hedging structural foreign currency exposures only in limited circumstances to protect the capital ratio or the US dollar value of capital invested.

Such hedging would be undertaken using forward foreign exchange contracts or by financing the borrowings in the same currencies as the functional currencies involved.

## Capital management

The Dubai Financial Services Authority ('DFSA') is the lead regulator of the bank.

The bank's objective is to ensure that capital resources are at all times adequate and efficiently used. This implies assessing the bank's capital demand and maintaining the capital supply at the required level. The bank's approach to capital management is driven by strategic and organisational requirements, taking into account the regulatory, economic and commercial environment in which it operates in. The bank's policy on capital management is underpinned by a capital management process and the internal capital adequacy assessment process, which enables it to manage its capital in a consistent manner.

The DFSA supervises the bank and, receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the bank. Individual branches and subsidiaries are directly regulated by their local banking supervisors, where applicable, who set and monitor their capital adequacy requirements.

The bank's regulatory capital is divided into two tiers:

- -Tier 1 capital comprises equity share capital, share premium, retained earnings, other comprehensive income and other reserves. This is adjusted for the amount of cash flow hedge reserve related to gains or losses on cash flow hedges of financial instruments, all unrealised gains or losses on liabilities that are valued at fair value and which result from changes in the bank's own credit quality and deduction for intangible assets.
- -Tier 2 capital comprises qualifying non-equity preference share capital, share premium and general provisions limited to 1.25% of Credit Risk Weighted Assets.

Further details in respect of the group's Capital requirement are set out on page 75.

The above table discloses the nominal principal amounts which represents the maximum amounts at risk should contracts be fully drawn upon and clients default. As a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of these nominal principal amounts is not representative of future liquidity requirements.

Included in the above are the following contingent liabilities on account of other members of the HSBC Group:

## Guarantees

The group provides guarantees and similar undertakings on behalf of both third-party customers and other entities within the group. These guarantees are generally provided in the normal course of the group's banking business. The principal types of guarantees provided, and the maximum potential amount of future payments which the group could be required to make at 31 December were as follows:

1 Financial guarantees are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss incurred because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due.

2 These guarantees are contracts that have similar features to financial guarantee contracts. The amounts disclosed in the above table are nominal principal amounts and reflect the group's maximum exposure under a large number of individual guarantee undertakings. The risks and exposures arising from guarantees are captured and managed in accordance with the group's overall credit risk management policies and procedures. Guarantees with terms of more than one year are subject to the group's annual credit review process.

## Other commitments

In addition to the commitments disclosed above, at 31 December 2024 the group had no capital commitments to purchase, within one year, land and building and other fixed assets (2023: nil).

## Associates

The group and its operations are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Management is of the opinion that the eventual outcome of the legal and financial liability is not expected to materially affect the group's financial position and operations.

## 33 Finance lease receivables

The group leases a variety of assets to third parties under finance leases, including transport assets (such as aircraft). At the end of lease terms, assets may be sold to third parties or leased for further terms. Rentals are calculated to recover the cost of assets less their residual value, and earn finance income.

## 34 Legal proceedings and regulatory matters

The group is party to legal proceedings and regulatory matters in a number of jurisdictions arising out of its normal business operations. Apart from the matters described below, the group considers that none of these matters are material. The recognition of provisions is determined in accordance with the accounting policies set out in Note 2. While the outcome of legal proceedings and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, management believes that, based on the information available to it, appropriate provisions have been made in respect of these matters as at 31 December 2024. Where an individual provision is material, the fact that a provision has been made is stated and quantified, except to the extent doing so would be seriously prejudicial. Any provision recognised does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. It is not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate of potential liability for our legal proceedings and regulatory matters as a class of contingent liabilities.

## US Anti-Terrorism Act Related Litigation

Since November 2014, a number of lawsuits have been filed in federal courts in the US against various HSBC companies including HSBC Bank Middle East Limited and others on behalf of plaintiffs who are, or are related to, victims of terrorist attacks in the Middle East. In each case, it is alleged that the defendants aided and abted the unlawful conduct of various sanctioned parties in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act or provided banking services to customers alleged to have connections to terrorism financing. Seven actions, which seek damages for unspecified amounts, remain pending and HSBC's motions to dismiss have been granted in three of these cases. These dismissals are subject to appeals and/or the plaintiffs re-pleading their claims. The four other actions are at an early stage.

Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.

## Other litigation

The group was named as one of the defendants in a lawsuit filed in the Courts of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates by a Jordanian company. The lawsuit sought damages from the defendants, including the group, in the amount of US$33m for losses allegedly suffered by the plaintiff arising out of a series of payments made between 2007 and 2009. In June 2024, the Court of Cassation awarded the plaintiff approximately US$39.7m in damages but later reversed its decision and ordered reconsideration. In November 2024, the Court of Cassation issued a new judgment, dismissing all claims against the group while upholding the liability of the other defendants. As the plaintiff has not filed any further challenge, this matter is now considered closed.

In March 2022, a claim was filed before the Urgent Matters Court in Algeria against the group and one other defendant claiming US$40m in relation to a court hold received by the group in 2019 which related to a customer of the group. In April 2023, following an appeal by the plaintiff, the Court of Cassation remanded the case to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration by a different panel of judges and in January 2024, the Court of Appeal decided to dismiss the plaintiff's appeal in its entirety. As the plaintiff has not filed any further appeal, this matter is now considered closed.

It also includes information about how we do business. The information in this section is not audited.

## Top and emerging risks

Our current top and emerging risks are as follows:

## Externally driven

## Geopolitical and Macroeconomic risks

Our operations and portfolios are exposed to risks from political instability, evolving trade policies, and regulatory changes. A recalibration of economic and trade policies is expected present recent election in various geographies including in US, and the uncertainty has increased, widening the distribution of economic risk. Recent ceasefire agreements involving Israel, Hezbollah, and Hamas have helped reduce the risk of escalating regional tensions. However, economic pressures on Iran are expected to persist, leading to continued volatility of oil prices. Disruptions in Red Sea shipping may ease if attacks subside, helping stabilize Egypt's Suez Canal revenues and reducing trade costs along the Asia-Europe corridor. Additionally, global trade and technology tensions are contributing to divergent regulatory standards, creating long-term strategic challenges for multinational businesses. We remain committed to complying with all applicable laws across jurisdictions while managing regulatory complexities. Our approach includes portfolio reviews, stress testing, and scenario analysis to mitigate risks and ensure resilience. Rigorous monitoring at the country level supports the reliability and appropriateness of our risk management strategies.

## Environmental, social and governance ('ESG') risks

The group is subject to ESG risks, including in relation to climate change, nature and human rights. These risks have increased owing to the pace and volume of regulatory developments globally, signing of diverging national agendas, increasing frequency of severe weather events, which require careful monitoring, and may impact financial and non-financial risks due to stakeholders placing more emphasis on financial institutions' actions and investment decisions in respect of ESG matters. Failure to meet these evolving expectations may result in financial and non-financial risks, including reputational, legal and regulatory compliance risks. Through our climate risk programme, we made progress on embedding climate considerations throughout our organisation, including through risk policy updates. We also developed risk metrics to monitor and manage exposures, and further enhanced our internal climate scenario analysis. We will continue to implement our climate risk programme to complete our annual liability assessment and make changes to our policies, processes and capabilities to better embed climate considerations throughout our organisation.

## Financial Crime risk environment

We are exposed to financial crime risk from our customers, staff and third parties engaging in criminal activity. The financial crime risk environment is heightened due to increasingly complex geopolitical challenges, the macroeconomic outlook, the complex and divergent nature of sanctions, evolving financial crime regulations, rapid technological developments, an increasing number of national data privacy requirements and the increasing sophistication of fraud. As a result, we will continue to face the possibility of regulatory enforcement, reputational risk and losses due to fraud. A number of Middle East countries have recently been and continue to be subject to a mutual evaluation review by the Financial Action Task Force ("FATF"). We are strengthening and investing in our financial crime, fraud and surveillance controls, to introduce next generation capabilities to protect both customers and the Group.

## Evolving regulatory environment risk

The group keeps abreast of the rapidly evolving regulatory compliance and conduct agenda, which currently includes, but is not limited to: ESG matters; operational resilience; how digital and technology changes, including payments, are impacting financial institutions; how we are ensuring good customer outcomes, including addressing customer vulnerabilities; regulatory reporting; and employee compliance. We monitor regulatory developments closely and engage with regulators to help ensure new regulatory requirements are implemented effectively and in a timely way. We have continued to embed our regulatory management systems focused on horizon scanning, regulatory mapping, and regulatory content for our inventory.

## Technology and Cyber Security Risk

We recognize the potential for service disruptions or data loss due to technology failures or cybersecurity threats. To address this, we continuously monitor technological advancements and the evolving threat landscape, including geopolitical and macroeconomic factors that may impact third-party risk management. As part of our commitment to resilience, we have a continuous improvement program in place to enhance the stability and security of our technology operations in an increasingly complex cyber environment. We invest in the reliability of our technology systems and critical services, ensuring that third-party providers uphold the same standards. Our approach prioritizes the protection of our customers, affiliates, and counterparties while minimizing service disruptions. By implementing robust business and technical controls, we proactively prevent, detect, manage, and recover from potential risks in a timely manner, aligning with our risk appetite.

## Digitisation and technological advance risk

Developments in technology and changes in regulations continue to enable new entrants to the banking industry as well as new products and services offered by competitors. This challenges us to continue to innovate with new digital capabilities and evolve our products, to attract, retain and best serve our customers. Along with opportunities, new technology, including generative Artificial Intelligence, can introduce risks and disruption. We seek to ensure technology developments are managed with appropriate controls and oversight.

## Internally driven

## Data risk

We use data to serve our customers and run our operations, often in real-time within digital experiences and processes. Ensuring accurate and timely data is essential to effectively serving our customers, maintaining operational resilience, and meeting regulatory requirements. Any inconsistencies or delays may pose challenges in these areas. Through our global data management framework, we proactively monitor the quality, availability and security of data that supports our customers and internal processes. We protect customer data via our data privacy framework, which establishes practices, design principles and guidelines that enable us to demonstrate compliance with data privacy laws and regulations. We continue to make improvements to our data policies and to our control framework to enhance the end-to-end management of data risk. We continue to modernise our data and analytics infrastructure through investments in Cloud technology, data visualisation, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We educate our employees on data risk and data management and have delivered global mandatory training on the importance of protecting data and managing data appropriately.

## Risks arising from the receipt of services from third parties

We procure goods and services from a range of third parties. Due to the current macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, the risk of service disruption in our supply chain remains heightened. We continue to strengthen our controls, oversight and risk management policies and processes to select and manage third parties, including our third parties' own supply chains, particularly for key activities that could affect our operational resilience.

## Change execution risk

Delivering change effectively is critical to achieving our strategy and enables us to meet rapidly evolving customer and stakeholder needs. We deliver complex change in line with established risk management processes, prioritising sustainable outcomes and understanding the associated risks. We focus on meeting industry and regulatory expectations and fulfilling our obligations to customers and clients and the marketplace we operate in.

## Model Risk

We use models in both financial and nonfinancial contexts, as well as in a range of business applications. Evolving regulatory requirements are driving material changes to the way model risk is managed across the banking industry, with a particular focus on capital models. New technologies, including Artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, are driving a need for enhanced model risk controls. We continue to enhance our model risk framework in response to changes in regulation and external factors. AI and machine learning models remain a key focus. Progress has been made in enhancing governance activity in this area with particular focus on generative AI due to the pace of technological change and regulatory and wider interest in adoption and usage.

## Risks associated with workforce capability, capacity and environmental factors with potential impact on growth

Our businesses, functions and countries are exposed to risks associated with employee retention and talent availability, changing skills requirements of our workforce, increasing our workforce nationalization requirements and compliance with employment laws and regulations. Attrition across the Group remains stable, but failure to manage these risks may impact the delivery of our strategic objectives or lead to regulatory sanctions or legal claims, and the risks are heightened during the current period of fundamental organizational change. We continue to invest in recruitment and retention of local nationals. Our Future Skills curriculum helps provide critical skills that will enable employees and HSBC to be successful in the future. We develop succession plans for key management roles, with actions agreed and reviewed on a regular basis by the Board.

## Capital requirement

The DFSA's capital requirements are prescribed in the DFSA Prudential - Investment, Insurance Intermediation and Banking Module ('PIB'). In accordance with the PIB:

- -the capital requirement for an authorised firm is calculated, subject to (2), as the higher of:
- -the applicable Base Capital Requirement as set out in the PIB; or
- -its Risk Capital Requirement plus applicable Capital Buffer Requirements.
- -where the authorised firm has an Individual Capital Requirement ('ICR') imposed on it then the Capital Requirement is its ICR plus Risk Capital Requirement plus applicable Capital Buffer Requirements.

An authorised firm must calculate its Risk Capital Requirement as the sum of the following:

- -the Credit Risk Capital Requirement;
- -the Market Risk Capital Requirement;
- -the Operational Risk Capital Requirement; and
- -the Displaced Commercial Risk Capital Requirement, where applicable.

Further, the bank is subject to a Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5% of Risk Weighted Assets and must constitute only CET1 Capital.

The PIB requires an authorised firm to:

- -appropriately apply a risk-weight to all on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures for capital adequacy purposes. A risk-weight is based on a Credit Quality Grade aligned with the likelihood of counterparty default;
- -calculate the Credit Risk Capital Requirement for its on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures; and
- -reduce the Credit Risk Capital Requirement for its on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures where the exposure is covered fully or partly by some form of eligible Credit Risk mitigant.

The DFSA has granted approval to the bank to use HSBC Group internal models for the purposes of calculating Market Risk Requirements.

The bank uses the Standardised Approach for the calculation of Operational Risk Capital Requirement.

The bank's regulatory capital is divided into two tiers:

- -Tier 1 capital comprises equity share capital, share premium, retained earnings, other comprehensive income and other reserves. This is adjusted for the amount of cash flow hedge reserve related to gains or losses on cash flow hedges of financial instruments, all unrealised gains or losses on liabilities that are valued at fair value and which result from changes in the bank's own credit quality and deduction for intangible assets.
- -Tier 2 capital comprises qualifying non-equity preference share capital, share premium and general provisions limited to 1.25% of Credit Risk Weighted Assets.

In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, DFSA in its letter to the bank dated 25 June 2020, decided to extend and refresh its approach to IFRS-9 transitional arrangements by introducing a prudential filter to smoothen the impact of Covid-19 related ECLs on banks' capital resources. The bank in response to DFSA letter, starting 30 June 2020 elected to apply transitional arrangement for a 5-years transition period using dynamic approach as follows:

- -Compare Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL provisions at the respective reporting date with the ECL provisions as at 31 December 2019.
- -Add back 100% of the increased ECLs to its Common Equity Tier 1 ('CET1') capital in the 2020 and 2021 Financial Years. This add back will then be phased out on a straight line basis over the subsequent years i.e. 2022-2024.

At 31 December 2024, no prudential filter was applied as the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL provisions were lower compared to ECL provisions as at 31 December 2019.
