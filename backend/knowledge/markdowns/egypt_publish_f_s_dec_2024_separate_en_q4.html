<p>The financial statements have been approved by the board of directors on 20 January 2025.</p>
<h2>2 Summary of significant accounting policies</h2>
<p>The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise disclosed.</p>
<h2>2.1 Basis of preparation of the financial statements</h2>
<p>The separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) rules approved by its Board of Directors on December 16, 2008. As well as in accordance with the instructions of preparing the financial statements of banks in accordance with the requirements of IFRS (9) Financial Instruments issued by the Central Bank of Egypt dating February 26, 2019.</p>
<h2>2.2 Segment reporting</h2>
<p>An operating segment is a group of assets and operations providing products or services whose risks and benefits are different from those associated with products or services provided by other operating segments. A geographical segment provides products or services within a specific economic environment characterized by risks and benefits different from those related to other geographical segments operating in a different economic environment.</p>
<h2>2.3 Foreign currency translation</h2>
<h2>2.3.1 Functional and presentation currency</h2>
<p>The financial statements of the bank are presented in the Egyptian pound which is the bank's functional and presentation currency.</p>
<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<h2>2.3.2 Foreign currency transactions and balances</h2>
<p>The Bank maintains its accounting records in Egyptian pounds. Transactions in foreign currencies during the year are translated into the Egyptian pounds using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at end of reporting year at the exchange rates then prevailing. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement and translation of such transactions and balances are recognized in the income statement and reported under the following line items: -</p>
<ul>
<li>· "Net trading income" or "net income from financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss" for assets and liabilities held for trading, as at fair value through profit or loss.</li>
<li>· Other operating income (expenses) for the remaining assets and liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes in the fair value of investments in debt instruments, which represent monetary financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and classified as FVOCI assets (debt instrument) are analyzed into differences resulting from changes in the amortized cost of the instrument, differences resulting from changes in the applicable exchange rates and differences resulting from changes in the fair value of the instrument. Valuation differences resulting from changes in the amortized cost are recognized in the income statement in "income from loans and similar revenues", whereas differences resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates are recognized in "other operating revenues and expenses". The remaining differences resulting from changes in fair value are deferred in equity and accumulated in the "fair value reserve in other comprehensive income".</p>
<ul>
<li>· Valuation differences arising on the measurement of non-monetary items at fair value include gains or losses resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate those items. Total fair value changes arising on the measurement of equity instruments classified as at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in the income statement, whereas total fair value changes arising on the measurement of equity instruments classified as FVOCI are recognized directly in equity in the "Fair value revaluation reserve" in Other comprehensive income.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.4 Treasury bills</h2>
<p>Treasury bills are carried at the balance sheet at face value, net of unearned interest and expected credit loss provision.</p>
<h2>2.5 Financial assets and financial liabilities</h2>
<p>Financial assets classified as amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification depends on the business model of the financial assets that are managed with its contractual cash flow and is determined by management at the time of initial recognition.</p>

<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<h2>Financial assets at amortized cost</h2>
<p>The financial asset is retained in the business model of financial assets held to collect contractual cash flow. The objective from this business model is to collect contractual cash flow which represented in principal and interest. The sale is an exceptional event for the purpose of this model and under the terms of the standard represented in following:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Significant deterioration for the issuer of financial instrument;</li>
<li>-Lowest sales in terms of rotation and value;</li>
<li>-A clear and reliable documentation process for the justification of each sale and its conformity with the requirements of the standard.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income</h2>
<p>The financial asset is retained in the business model of financial assets held to collect contractual cash flows and sales. Held to collect contractual cash flows and sales are integrated to achieve the objective of the model. Sales are high in terms of turnover and value as compared to the business model retained for the collection of contractual cash flows.</p>
<h2>Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss</h2>
<p>The financial asset is held in other business models including trading, management of financial assets at fair value, maximization of cash flows through sale.</p>
<p>The objective of the business model is not to retain the financial asset for the collection of contractual or retained cash flows for the collection of contractual cash flows and sales. Collecting contractual cash flows is an incidental event for the objective of the model.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the business model are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Structuring a set of activities designed to extract specific outputs.</li>
<li>-Represents a complete framework for a specific activity (inputs - activities - outputs);</li>
<li>-The business model can include sub-business models.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following conditions are to be met in the financial assets that the Bank can classify on acquisition at fair value through profit or loss:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Be on the stock exchange of domestic or foreign securities.</li>
<li>-To have an active transaction during the three months preceding the date of acquisition.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.6 Offsetting of financial instruments</h2>
<p>Financial assets and liabilities are offset when the bank has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and it intention to settle the amount on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.</p>
<h2>2.7 Derivative financial instruments</h2>
<p>Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting year. Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices in an active market, recent market transactions, or valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and options pricing models, as appropriate. All derivatives are presented as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.</p>
<p>Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments, such as the conversion option in a convertible bond, are treated as separate derivatives when they meet the definition of a derivative and where their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract, provided that the host contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.</p>
<h2>Emirates NBD - (S.A.E.)</h2>
<h2>Notes to the for the year ended 31 December 2024</h2>
<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>This implied derivative are measured with fair value, changes in derivative are initially recognized at fair value through profit or loss in net trading income, and this implied derivative didn't separated unless the bank choose to classify host contract in full at fair value through profit or loss.</p>
<p>The timing of recognition in profit or loss, of any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives, depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and the nature of the item being hedged. The Bank designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments of:</p>
<ul>
<li>· The exposure to changes in fair value of recognized assets, liabilities or unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedge);</li>
<li>· The exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or</li>
<li>· Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation (Investment hedge).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.8 Interest income and expense</h2>
<p>Interest income and expense for all interest-bearing financial instruments, except for those classified as held for trading or designated as at fair value through profit or loss, are recognized within 'interest income' and 'interest expense' line items in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.</p>
<p>The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant year. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter year, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability on initial recognition. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Bank estimates the future cash flows of the financial instrument on the basis of contractual terms of that instrument (for example, prepayment options) but does not consider any future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.</p>
<p>The Bank ceases to recognize in profit or loss interest income on non-performing or impaired loans and receivables. It is rather marginalized and recorded off balance sheet in statistical records. Interest income on these loans is recognized in revenue on a cash basis as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>-For retail, personal housing and small business loans: when interest income is collected and after recovery of all arrears.</li>
<li>-For corporate loans, interest income is also recognized on the cash-basis where subsequent interest is accreted on the loan in accordance with the reschedule arrangement until the bank collects 25% of the rescheduled installments, provided that payment of such installments continue for at least one year. Thereafter, and as the customer continues to pay the rescheduled installments, incremental interest accruing on the principal then outstanding (interest on the rescheduled performing loan) is recognized in revenues. Interest that is marginalized prior to the date when the loan becomes performing is not recognized in profit or loss except when the total balance of the loan, prior to that date, is paid in full.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.9 Fees and commissions income</h2>
<p>Fees charged for servicing a loan or facility are recognized as revenue as the service is provided. Fees and commissions on non-performing or impaired loans or receivables cease to be recognized as income and are rather recorded off balance sheet. These are recognized as revenue - on the cash basis - only when interest income on those loans is recognized in profit or loss, in which event, fees and commissions that are an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial asset are treated as an adjustment to the effective interest rate of that financial asset and recognized in revenue.</p>
<h2>Emirates NBD - (S.A.E.)</h2>
<h2>Notes to the for the year ended 31 December 2024</h2>
<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>Commitment fees received by the Bank to originate a loan are deferred if it is probable that the Bank will enter into a specific lending arrangement and are regarded as a compensation for an ongoing involvement with the acquisition of the financial instrument and recognized as an adjustment to the effective interest rate. If the commitment expires without the Bank making the loan, the fees are recognized as revenue on expiry.</p>
<p>Loan syndication fees received by the Bank are recognized as revenue when the syndication has been completed, provided that the Bank which arranges the loan retains no part of the loan package for itself or retains a part at the same effective interest rate for comparable risk as other participants.</p>
<p>Fees and commissions that are earned on negotiating or participating in the negotiation of a transaction in favor of third party, such as arrangements for the allotment of shares or another financial instrument or acquisition or sale of an enterprise on behalf of a client, are recognized as revenue when the transaction has been completed. Administrative consultations and other service fees are usually recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the year in which the service is rendered. Fees from financial planning management and custodian services provided to clients over long years are usually recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the year in which these services are rendered.</p>
<h2>2.10 Dividends income</h2>
<p>Dividends income on investments in equity instruments and similar assets is recognized in the income statement when the bank's right to receive payment is established.</p>
<h2>2.11 REPO agreements</h2>
<p>The financial instruments sold under repurchase agreement (Repo's) are disclosed in asset side added to treasury bills and the financial instruments purchased under resell agreements (Reverse Repo's) are discounted from treasury bills as it's considered commitment or lending using treasury bills as collateral . The difference between selling price and repurchase price or between purchase price and resell price is recognized as (Debit /Credit) interest and worth over the year of the agreement using the real effective interest rate method.</p>
<h2>2.12 Impairment of financial assets</h2>
<p>The Bank reviews all its financial assets except for financial assets that are measured at fair value through profit or loss to assess the extent of impairment as described below.</p>
<p>Financial assets are classified at three stages at each reporting date:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Stage 1: Financial assets that have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk since the date of initial recognition, and the expected credit loss is calculated for 12 months.</li>
<li>-Stage 2: Financial assets that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since the initial recognition or the date on which the investments are made, and the expected credit loss is calculated over the life of the asset.</li>
<li>-Stage 3: Financial assets that have impaired in value and for which there is evidence that they have become troubled (irregular), which requires calculating their expected credit loss for the entire life of the asset based on the difference between the book value of loans and credit facilities and the present value of expected future cash flows.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are excluded from the calculation of expected credit losses:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Deposits with banks have a maturity of one month or less from the date of the financial position.</li>
<li>-Current accounts at banks</li>
<li>-Balances with the Central Bank in local currency</li>
<li>-Sovereign debts issued by Egyptian Government dermnited in Egyptian pound</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes to the for the year ended 31 December 2024</h2>
<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<h2>Significant increase in credit risk</h2>
<p>The Bank considers that the financial instrument has experienced a significant increase in the credit risk when one or more of the following quantitative and qualitative criteria have been met, as well as factors relating to default.</p>
<h2>Quantitative criteria:</h2>
<p>The quantitative criteria fall into two parts: First, the deterioration in the credit rating of the instrument, which is represented by a significant increase in the probability of failure during the remaining life of the instrument from the date of the financial position compared to the probability of failure during the remaining life expected upon initial recognition, according to the risk structure accepted by the bank. Secondly, a non-payment period of more than 30 days for the instrument.</p>
<p>According to the circular issued by the Central Bank of Egypt on December 14, 2021 regarding the temporary amendment of the treatment of non-performing loans to small and medium-sized companies so that they are considered irregular in the event of non-compliance with contractual terms, such as the presence of receivables equal to or exceeding 180 consecutive days. Note that the original period is 60 days, reduced at a rate of 10 days annually to become 30 days within 3 years from the date of application (2019).</p>
<p>Noting that, according to the Central Bank circular issued on July 1, 2024, the following will be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Gradually cancel the exception for including customers from the small and medium enterprises sector in the third phase during a period of 18 months until the end of December 2025, so that this category of customers will be included in the third phase in the event of non-compliance with the contractual terms of the credit facilities granted to customers as follows:</li>
<li>- The presence of receivables equal to or more than 180 consecutive days until the end of December 2024.</li>
<li>- The presence of receivables equal to or more than 150 consecutive days until the end of June 2025.</li>
<li>- The presence of receivables equal to or more than 120 consecutive days until the end of December 2025. This will result in the inclusion of customers in the third phase when there are receivables equal to or more than 90 consecutive days as of January 2026.</li>
<li>2. Extending the clause related to upgrading customers from the third stage to the second stage if all quantitative and qualitative elements for the second stage are met and the due set-aside/marginalized returns (as the case may be) are paid regularly for a period of 90 days, until the end of December 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Qualitative criteria:</h2>
<h2>Retail loans, micro and small businesses.</h2>
<p>If the borrower encounters one or more of the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>o The borrower submits a request to convert short-term to long-term payments due to negative effects on the borrower's cash flows.</li>
<li>o Extension of the deadline for repayment at the borrower's request.</li>
<li>o Frequent Past dues over the previous 12 months.</li>
<li>o Future adverse economic changes affecting the borrower's future cash flows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Corporate loans for small and medium size entities</p>
<p>If the borrower has a follow-up list and / or financial instrument faced one or more of the following events (For example and not restriction):</p>
<ul>
<li>o A significant increase in the rate of return on the financial asset as a result of increased credit risk.</li>
<li>o Significant negative changes in the activity and physical or economic conditions in which the borrower operates.</li>
</ul>

<li>o Scheduling request as a result of difficulties facing the borrower.</li>
<li>o Significant negative changes in actual or expected operating results or cash flows.</li>
<li>o Negative changes in any of the guarantees or guarantees provided by a third party or by the borrower and provided against obligations, which may lead to doubts about the borrower's commitment to cover the gap in exposure.</li>
<li>o Future economic changes affecting the borrower's future cash flows.</li>
<li>o Early indicators of cash flow / liquidity problems such as delays in servicing creditors / business loans.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transfer between three stages 1.2.3:</h2>
<h2>Transfer from the second stage to the first stage:</h2>
<p>The financial asset shall not be transferred from the second stage to the first stage unless all the quantitative and qualitative elements of the first stage are met and the full arrears of the financial asset and the proceeds are paid, and the account goes through a recuperation period to confirm regular payment of 12 months.</p>
<h2>Transfer from the third stage to second:</h2>
<p>The financial asset shall not be transferred from the third stage to the second stage until all the following conditions have been met:</p>
<ul>
<li>-A completion of all quantitative and qualitative elements of the second stage</li>

<li>-Regularity of repayment for at least 12 months</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between the allowance account is considered according to the principles of creditworthiness (A) and the allowance account according to the expected credit loss (B), while if (A) &gt; (B) the general bank risk reserve increases from the distribution of net profit and is included in equity. Property. If (A)</p>
<h2>2.13 Intangible Assets</h2>
<h2>Computer software</h2>
<p>Expenditure on upgrade and maintenance of computer programs is recognized as an expense in the income statement when incurred. Expenditures directly incurred in connection with specific software are recognized as intangible assets if they are controlled by the Bank and when it is probable that they will generate future economic benefits that exceed its cost within more than one year. Cost of a computer software recognized as an asset shall be amortized over the year of expected benefits within a range of three to five years.</p>
<h2>2.14 Fixed Assets</h2>
<h2>Property, plant and equipment</h2>
<p>Property, plant and equipment basically comprise premises of the head office, branches and offices. All items of property, plant and equipment are carried at historical cost net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of these assets.</p>
<h2>Emirates NBD - (S.A.E.)</h2>
<h2>Notes to the for the year ended 31 December 2024</h2>
<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>Subsequent costs are included in the carrying amount of an item or recognized separately, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with that item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance expenses are recognized in profit or loss in "other operating costs" line item during the financial year in which they are incurred.</p>
<p>The Bank has modified the productive life of the new fixed assets as of 1 May, 2017 in order to unifying to the productive life of the group in Dubai and to consolidate the accounting policies used for all units owned by the Bank.</p>
<p>Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of other assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method to the extent of their estimated residual values. Depreciation rates as set out below.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>Buildings</td><td>25-60 years</td></tr><tr><td>Facade</td><td>25-30 years</td></tr><tr><td>Public fixtures</td><td>10-20 years</td></tr><tr><td>Constructions and leasehold improvements</td><td>7-10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Computers hardware</td><td>3-5 years</td></tr><tr><td>ATM machines</td><td>5-7 years</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles</td><td>3-5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment and vaults</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and fixtures</td><td>5 years</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The useful lives of constructions and leasehold improvements are 10 years for owner-occupied properties and 7 years for leased properties.</p>
<p>At the end of each reporting year, residual values and useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed and adjusted, where appropriate. The Bank reviews the carrying amounts of its depreciable fixed assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets may not be recovered. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of the asset's net realizable value or value in use.</p>
<p>Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing net proceeds with relevant carrying amount. These are included in profit or loss in other operating income (expenses) in the income statement.</p>
<h2>2.15 Assets reverted to the Bank in settlement of debt.</h2>
<p>Assets reverted to the Bank in settlement of debt are recognized with the value which reverted to the Bank with. This represent the debt value which the management decided to waive in exchange of the asset .and in case there is an objective evidence of an impairment loss in the value of these assets in later date, so the loss is measured as the difference between book value and current value of the future cash flow discounted by market rate of similar asset or net realizable value of the asset (whichever is higher) and this for each asset separately. Reduction of the book value of the asset through an impairment account and loss is recognized in income statement in (other operating income / expense), and if possible in any subsequent periods to link the decrease in impairment loss with an event happened after the impairment loss, so impairment loss is reversed to income statement and at the date of loss reversal, the assets should not exceed the initial value of the asset.</p>
<h2>2.16 Impairment of non-financial assets:</h2>
<p>Non-financial assets that do not have definite useful lives, except for goodwill, are not amortized. These are annually tested for impairment. Depreciable property and equipment are tested for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets may not be recovered. Impairment loss is recognized and the carrying amount of an asset is reduced to the extent that such carrying amount exceeds the asset's recoverable amount.</p>
<p>The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of the asset's net realizable value or value in use. For the purpose of estimating the impairment loss, where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the bank estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset</p>
<h2>Emirates NBD - (S.A.E.)</h2>
<h2>Notes to the for the year ended 31 December 2024</h2>
<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>belongs is estimated. At the end of each year, the bank reviews non-financial assets for which an impairment loss is recognized to assess whether or not all or part of such impairment losses should be reversed through profit or loss.</p>
<h2>2.17 Leases</h2>
<p>The accounting treatment for the finance lease is complied with law 95/1995, if the contract entitles the lessee to purchase the asset at a specified date and predefined value, or the current value of the total lease payments representing at least 90% of the value of the asset. The other leases contracts are considered operating leases contracts.</p>
<h2>2.18 The Bank as a lessee</h2>
<p>Finance lease contract recognizes the lease cost, including the cost of maintenance of the leased assets in the income statement for the period in which they occurred. If the Bank decides to exercise the right to purchase the leased asset the leased assets are capitalized and included in 'property, plant and equipment' and depreciated over the useful life of the expected remaining life of the asset in the same manner as similar asset.</p>
<h2>2.19 Cash and cash equivalents</h2>
<p>For the purpose of the cash flows statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with maturities of less than three months from date of acquisition and include cash and balances at central banks, other than those under the mandatory reserve, current accounts at banks and treasury bills.</p>
<h2>2.20 Other provisions</h2>
<p>Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognized when the Bank has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.</p>
<p>Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations is remote.</p>
<p>When a provision is wholly or partially no longer required, it is reversed through profit or loss under other operating income (expenses) line item.</p>
<p>Provisions due within more than one year from the balance sheet date are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation, at the balance sheet date, using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. Where an obligation matures within one year or less, provisions are calculated based on undiscounted expected outflows unless the time value of money has a significant impact on the amount of provision, then it is measured at the present value.</p>

<h2>2.21 Financial guarantees contracts</h2>
<p>A financial guarantee contract is a contract issued by the bank as security for loans or overdrafts due from its clients to other entities that requires the bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantees are generally issued by the bank to beneficiary banks, corporations and other entities on behalf of the bank's clients.</p>
<p>When a financial guarantee is recognized initially, it is measured at its fair value plus, transaction costs that is directly attributable to the issue of such financial guarantee. After initial recognition, a financial guarantee contract issued by the bank is measured at the higher of:</p>
<ul>
<li>-The amount initially recognized less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization of security fees recognized as income in profit or loss using the straight-line method over the term of the guarantee; and</li>
<li>-The best estimate for the payments required to settle any financial obligation resulting from the financial guarantee at the reporting date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such estimates are made based on experience in similar transactions and historical losses as guarantee, shall be recognized within other operating income (expenses) in the income statement.</p>
<h2>2.22 Employees' benefits</h2>
<h2>Defined contribution plans</h2>
<p>A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Bank pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Bank has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to their service in the current and prior years. The Bank has two defined contribution plans, one of them to be paid to Social Insurance Authority and the other one to one of a fund management company.</p>
<p>The Bank pays contributions to the Social Insurance Authority and to fund manager where it shall be under no additional obligation once such contributions have been paid. Those contributions are recognized in profit or loss as employee benefits cost in the year when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.</p>
<h2>Employees profit share</h2>
<p>The Bank pays to its employees a profit share as a percentage of the expected distributable cash dividends. Such employees profit share is charged to equity as part of dividends and recognized as a liability when it is approved by the Bank's general assembly. No obligation is recognized for the employees share in undistributed profits.</p>

<h2>2.23 Income taxes</h2>
<p>Income tax expense on the year's profit or loss represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax and is recognized in the income statement, except when they relate to items that are recognized directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognized in equity.</p>
<p>The Bank's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year, in addition to income tax adjustments related to previous years.</p>
<p>Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.</p>
<p>Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.</p>
<p>The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. However, when it is expected that the tax benefit will increase, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets shall increase to the extent of previous reduction.</p>
<p>Offsetting between deferred tax assets and liabilities is made if the Bank has legal right for doing such off setting and when income tax is associated to the same tax department.</p>
<h2>2.24 Borrowings</h2>
<p>Loans obtained by the bank are initially recognized at fair value net of transaction costs incurred in connection with obtaining the loan. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost, with the difference between net proceeds and the value to be paid over the borrowing period, recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.</p>

<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<h2>A) Credit risk</h2>
<p>The bank takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk resulting from failure of counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk is considered to be the most significant risk for the bank, therefore, requiring careful management. The credit risk manifests itself in the lending activities including loans and facilities and investments in debt instruments. Credit risk also arises from the clients' failure to honour their obligations, thus, requiring the bank to pay these obligations on their behalf (i.e. contingent liabilities). The credit risk management and control in cooperation with the investigation department are centralised in a credit risk management team in Bank Treasury report to the Board of Directors and head of each business unit on a regular basis.</p>
<h2>Structure and organization of the bank's Risk Management.</h2>
<p>The Bank has a Borrowing Limit System whereby borrowing decisions are approved through an official risk management officer, in accordance with Emirates NBD rules. Risk management is completely separate of the business segments despite the subordination of the risk manager to the managing director of the bank in the career hierarchy and remains directly subordinate of group risk management in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<h2>Loans and Advances for banks and customers</h2>
<p>Credit approvals are obtained in accordance with the following procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Investigation Department issues a report based on meetings with the company's management and information collected from the market.</li>
<li>· Business Line meets the client and then issues the credit proposal based on the Investigation report, other collective information obtained and in light of the client's needs.</li>
<li>· Risk Department assesses the risk based on the credit proposal, Investigation report and on discussions with the Business Lines and then issues an opinion.</li>
<li>· A decision is taken by the appropriate level in accordance with the credit limits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bank concentration with foreign individual correspondent</h2>
<p>The bank has available policies concerning concentrations for correspondent abroad as these policies aim at limiting the concentration for currencies, banks or countries.</p>
<h2>Risk management objectives and policies and risk reporting or measurement systems</h2>
<p>Emirates NBD deals only with clients who are sufficiently known to the bank or whose market reputation is not doubtful. Additionally, the client business is thoroughly investigated by investigation report in accordance with the Central Bank of Egypt instructions. The bank periodically checks the sources of the amounts deposited by clients.</p>
<p>For the borrowers and guarantors, the audited accounts of the last three years - when available - are required (except for fully secured facilities) including consolidated and non-consolidated information for entities that belong to groups. Special attention is required for off-balance elements and for changes in financial statements and its basis of preparation. As for individuals or smaller entities that do not provide financial information, the bank is obliged to exercise its best effort to determine the financial position of debtors, their resources, indebtedness and other relevant indications.</p>

<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>Emirates NBD Bank Egypt has a comprehensive internal rating system provided by the Group where the internal master scale ratings based on Moody's Risk Analyst (MRA) are mapped to the Central Bank ORR in line with the description of each group of ratings. MRA master scale encompasses 29 ratings (26 performing and 3 nonperforming). Each Group of ratings (e.g., 1a, 1b, 1c...) has a specific description which reflects the creditworthiness of obligors within each category as well as the PD (Probability of Default). This is being used as the basis for the mapping to the ORR which is a 10-scale rating; of which 7 ratings are performing and 3 ratings are non-performing.</p>
<p>MRA supports sophisticated analysis of ratios and financial metrics. It produces a borrower rating and a 1-year probability of default (PD). Its assessment is created by combining a number of inputs. Each input is assessed individually, and then the scores are aggregated. This aggregated score is then mapped onto the data-type of the output. The inputs can have different datatypes. MRA is supported by Moody's and built in-house with inputs from concerned parties in the Group.</p>
<p>The following table provides an analysis of credit worthiness for corporations based on internal ratings compared with CBE ratings and includes rates of provisions needed for related to credit risks:</p>

<h2>Debt instruments, treasury bills and other governmental notes</h2>
<p>The bank uses the external ratings for debt instruments and treasury bills. When those ratings are not available, the bank uses methods similar to those applied in the evaluation of its credit customers. Investments in such securities and treasury bills are regarded as providing better credit quality and as an available source of liquidity to meet the financing requirements.</p>

<h2>Bank's risk management objectives and measurement</h2>
<p>The Bank established a complete comprehensive system to control and report on risk management. That system covers all activities of the Bank, and used to insure that loan agreements are properly implemented (in terms approved and used limits) and related acceptable risks are effectively controlled.</p>
<p>For corporate credit, the following reports are issued and reviewed prior to loan approvals:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Appropriate credit approval level.</li>
<li>-Validity/Periodical of the agreements signed by the borrower.</li>
<li>-Level and validity /periodical of securities.</li>
<li>-Data recorded in the system are in line with approved limit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impairment and provisioning policies</h2>
<p>Risk Management reviews all corporate and retail loans on monthly basis in order to determine provisions required according to CBE rules and internal bank rating which were previously approved by the CBE. The major balance of provision is related to last two rating levels. The table below shows balance sheet items related to loans and facilities based on CBE ratings as follows:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>31 December 24</td><td>31 December 23</td><td>31 December 23</td></tr><tr><td>Performing loans</td><td>93%</td><td>47%</td><td>92%</td></tr><tr><td>Regular watch list</td><td>2%</td><td>2%</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>special watch list</td><td>1%</td><td>5%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Non-performing loans</td><td>4%</td><td>46%</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The criteria adopted by the Bank help to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include:</p>
<ul>

<h2>The bank's policies for avoiding excessive risk concentration.</h2>
<p>In addition to carefully selecting and evaluating individual risks, the diversity of the Bank's credit portfolio is an essential element in managing its risks. Same as the geographic importance, the sector-related component represents an essential element in risk analysis, its follow-up and the portfolio management. The Bank must maintain a precise knowledge of industrial sectors through the evolution of their major companies, of macroeconomic data, as well as technical and regulatory evolutions.</p>
<p>The Bank adheres to avoid excessive concentrations of risks over countries where the political and economic infrastructures are known to be weak. In this concept, envelopes of country risks are fixed by the CCDG.</p>
<p>The Risk Department should verify regularly the dispersion of risk and should establish, if necessary, conduct rules in this matter. An analysis showing excessive concentration, or a negative economic evolution of a particular sector is the opportunity for making decisions that aim at reducing or containing the Bank's exposure to a particular sector, or to redefine its credit policy regarding the sector.</p>
<p>All the standard short-term facilities for financing the working investment and medium-term loans for financing the assets are proposed. Emirates NBD Egypt complies with the following CBE rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Any Single obligor exposure should not exceed 15% of the Bank's capital base.</li>
<li>· Exposure with a business group should not exceed 20% of the Bank's capital base.</li>
<li>· The total exposure with the clients of which each individual exposure totalizes more than 10% of the Bank's capital base should not exceed 8 times the Bank's capital base.</li>
<li>· The total amount of the loans granted by the Bank to corporate for financing acquisition is limited to 5% maximum of the total amount of the outstanding when such loan is requested.</li>

<h2>Market Risk</h2>
<p>The Bank is exposed to market risk represented by fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows resulting from changes in market prices. Market risk results from open positions in rate of return, currency and equity products, each of which is exposed to general and specific market movements and changes in the level of sensitivity to market rates or prices such as rates of return, exchange rates and equity instrument prices. The bank separates the extent of its exposure to market risk into portfolios for trading or for non-trading purposes.</p>
<h2>· Interest rate risk</h2>
<p>The bank is exposed to the effects of fluctuations in the levels of return rates prevailing in the market, which is the risk that the value of a financial instrument with a fixed return rate may fluctuate, or the risk of the fair value of the return rate, which is the risk of fluctuations in the value of the financial instrument as a result of changes in return rates in the market, and the future cash flows of financial instruments with a return rate. Variable and the return margin may increase as a result of these changes, but profits may decrease in the event of unexpected movements.</p>

<h2>· Price risk</h2>
<p>They arise from changes in market prices and may relate, for example, to changes in the prices of stocks, stock market indices or commodities. Variable return securities, financial derivatives and commodity derivatives are exposed to market price risk.</p>
<p>Market risks arise mainly from the trading book transactions carried out by the investment team and supervised by the Market Risk Department.</p>
<h2>The bank monitors these risks through market risk management, including the following:</h2>
<ul>
<li>- Defining and analyzing criteria and quantification of sensitivities that reflect underlying market risks.</li>
<li>- Work with business units to set limits on sensitivities and other comprehensive key indicators such as (VAR) Value at Risk.</li>
<li>- Issuing reports to executive management and senior heads of business lines.</li>
<li>- Setting limits for various market risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Confirming with exceed the granted limits: Special approvals may be granted on a case-by-case basis to change the limits temporarily or permanently. The amount exceeding the limit will be disclosed in accordance with the procedures followed, and the necessary measures will be taken based on the level of delegated authority in that regard.</p>
<h2>Measurement of market risk on trading activities</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Market risk on trading activities is measured using two different methods (VAR and sensitivity tests) designed to aggregate all risk probabilities, including potential changes resulting from a sudden and sharp decline in market conditions, in addition to the following limits:</p>
<p>Stop Loss &amp; NOP (Net open position)</p>
<h2>Measurement of market risk under normal market conditions as follows:</h2>
<p>(VAR) - Value at Risk: This statistical indicator is calculated using the model approved by Emirates NBD Headquarters and Emirates NBD Egypt as well. It estimates the potential loss on the trading portfolio under normal market conditions in one trading day, and the model is based on changes in the market over the past two years with a confidence level of 99%.</p>
<p>Global risk tracking systems (Fin-Mechanics and ERS) calculate the sensitivity of a portfolio position to various market determinants. It complements a series of market risk indicators used by the Bank to continuously adapt to the increasing complexity of particular markets.</p>

<h2>Portfolio valuation controls</h2>
<p>The Bank enhanced its portfolio valuation in terms of financial instrument valuations, gains or losses on capital market activities, and control processes.</p>
<p>The main areas of valuation control are:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Transaction recording.</li>
<li>· Market Parameter (MAP) Reviews (monthly reviews of book valuations).</li>
<li>· Model reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>The procedures for these controls are discussed below.</p>
<h2>Transaction recording controls</h2>

<h2>Market Parameter (MAP) Review</h2>
<p>RCM is responsible for MAP Review. This review entail a formal verification of all market parameters and are generally performed monthly; the more liquid parameters are reviewed daily. The information used for MAP Reviews is obtained from brokers and suppliers of consensus market prices.</p>
<p>The MAP Review methodology is outlined in separate procedure. All MAP Review conclusions are documented, and the corresponding adjustments are made in the middle-office books. MAP Review results are presented to business managers.</p>
<h2>Regular risk reports</h2>
<p>The following risk reports are generated on a regular basis:</p>
<p>Daily Market risk report for Treasury activity</p>
<p>Monthly Market Risk report to summarize the key event impacted ALM/Treasury activity.</p>
<p>ALCO reports to follow the risk of the total Bank.</p>
<h2>Market Risk related to banking activities</h2>

<h2>Equity risk</h2>
<p>Equity interests held by the Group outside the trading book are securities that convey a residual, subordinated claim on the assets or income of the issuer or have a similar economic substance. The Bank does not have Equity positions on December 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>Methods of measuring Currency risk</h2>
<p>The Bank calculates the net spot equivalent currency position in each currency. The net position is equal to the sum of all asset items less all liability items plus off-balance sheet items (including the forward currency position) These positions are translated into EGP at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date and aggregated to give the Bank's overall net open position in each currency. The net spot equivalent position in a given currency is long when assets exceed liabilities and (deficit) when liabilities exceed assets.</p>

<h2>Currencies risk and coverage for revenue of foreign currencies</h2>
<p>The risk of foreign currencies that the bank deal with related to the foreign currencies the ALM is responsible for coverage of the change in bank revenue due to currencies movement including the position that resulted from change in revenues.</p>
<h2>Interest rate risk</h2>
<h2>Interest rate risk management framework</h2>
<p>Interest rate risks on the commercial transactions are managed centrally by ALM-Treasury through the "commercial book". Interest rate risk on the Bank's equity and investments is also managed by ALM-Treasury, in the "equity book".</p>
<p>The main decisions concerning positions arising from retail banking activities are taken at ALCO committee meetings.</p>
<h2>Measurement of interest rate risk</h2>
<p>Maturities of outstanding assets are determined based on the contractual characteristics of the transactions and historical customer behavior. For retail banking products, behavioral models are based on historical data and econometric studies. The models deal with early repayments, current accounts in credit and debit and savings accounts. Theoretical maturities of equity capital are determined according to internal assumptions.</p>
<h2>Risk limits</h2>
<p>For the "commercial book", overall interest rate risk is subject to a primary limit. The limit is an interest rate gap limit, expressed as a percentage of customer deposits. This percentage is a declining function of the management year. This limit is used to manage long-term interest rate risk.</p>
<h2>Sensitivity of the value of banking Portfolios</h2>
<p>Since the books of financial instruments resulting from the Bank's retail banking activities are not intended to be sold, they are not managed on the basis of their value. To comply with the financial reporting rules prescribed by Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) , Emirates NBD Egypt determines the value of the financial instruments that make up these portfolios and the sensitivity of that value to interest rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>The table below shows the sensitivity of the value of consolidated banking portfolios, by currency and by maturity band, to an instantaneous movement of one basis point across the entire yield curve. The sensitivity data shown take account of the replication portfolios used to model theoretical maturities, especially on the Bank's equity.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of the value of banking intermediation books to an instantaneous change of one basis point in interest rates was an increase in value in the event of a fall and a decrease in value in the event of a rise in interest rates on 31 December 2024 EGP 796K compared by EGP 1,073K on 31 December 2023.</p>

<h2>Hedging of interest rate and currency risks</h2>
<p>Hedging relationships initiated by the Bank mainly consist of interest rate or currency hedges in the form of swaps or forwards.</p>
<p>Depending on the hedging objective, derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are qualified as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Each hedging relationship is formally documented at inception. The documentation describes the hedging strategy; identifies the hedged item and the hedging instrument, and the nature of the hedged risk; and describes the methodology used to test the expected (prospective) and actual (retrospective) effectiveness of the hedge.</p>
<h2>Interest rate risk in the banking Portfolio</h2>
<p>The Bank's strategy for managing global interest rate risk is based on closely monitoring the sensitivity of the Bank's earnings to changes in interest rates. In this way, it can determine how to achieve an optimum level of offset between different risks. This procedure requires an extremely accurate assessment of the risks incurred so that the Bank can determine the most appropriate hedging strategy, after considering the effects of netting the different types of risk.</p>
<p>No hedging strategies were in the Bank's books in 2024.</p>
<h2>C) Liquidity and refinancing risk</h2>
<p>Liquidity and refinancing risk are the risk of the Bank being unable to fulfill current or future foreseen or unforeseen cash or collateral requirements without affecting routine transactions or its financial position.</p>
<p>Liquidity and refinancing risk are managed through a global liquidity policy approved by ALCO and Board of Directors. This policy is based on management principles designed to apply both in normal conditions and in a liquidity crisis. The Bank's liquidity position is assessed on the basis of internal standards, warning flags and regulatory ratios.</p>
<h2>Liquidity Risk Management Policy</h2>
<h2>Policy objectives</h2>
<p>The objectives of the Bank's liquidity management policy are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. secure a balanced financing mix to support Emirates NBD Egypt's development strategy.</li>
<li>2. ensure that the Bank is always in a position to discharge its obligations to its customers.</li>
<li>3. ensure that it does not trigger a systemic crisis solely by its own actions.</li>
<li>4. comply with the standards set by the local banking supervisor.</li>
<li>5. Dealing with any liquidity crisis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Responsibilities liquidity risk management</h2>
<p>The Bank's Board of Directors sets the general liquidity risk management policy, including risk measurement principles, acceptable risk levels and the internal billing system. R-IRB MLR reports regularly to the ALCO on liquidity policy principles and the Bank's position.</p>
<p>ALM-Treasury proposes procedures for implementing the liquidity policy set by the Board of Directors. These proposals are then reviewed and approved by the ALCO. It is also informed of any crisis situation and is responsible for deciding on the allocation of crisis management roles and approving emergency plans.</p>
<p>After validation by the ALCO, ALM-Treasury is responsible for implementing the policy. It is also owner of the systems used to manage liquidity risk.</p>
<h2>Emirates NBD - (S.A.E.)</h2>
<h2>Notes to the for the year ended 31 December 2024</h2>
<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>R-IRB MLR contributes to defining liquidity policy principles. It also provides second-line control by validating the models, risk indicators, limits and market parameters used.</p>
<h2>Centralized liquidity risk management</h2>
<p>Liquidity risk is managed centrally by ALM-Treasury across all maturities. The Treasury unit is responsible for refinancing and for short-term issues, while the ALM unit is responsible for medium/long-term. ALM-Treasury is also tasked with providing financing to the Bank's core businesses and business lines, and investing their surplus cash.</p>
<h2>Liquidity risk management and supervision</h2>
<p>Day-to-day liquidity management is based on a full range of internal standards and warning flags at various maturities.</p>
<p>An overnight target is set for Treasury unit, limiting the amount raised on interbank overnight markets. This applies to the major currencies in which the Bank does business.</p>
<p>The refinancing capacity needed to cope with an unexpected surge in liquidity needs is regularly measured at Bank level. It mainly comprises available securities and loans eligible for central bank refinancing, available ineligible securities that can be sold under repurchase agreements or immediately on the market, and overnight loans not liable to be renewed.</p>
<p>Medium- and long-term liquidity management is based mainly on an analysis of the medium- and long-term sources of funds available to finance assets with the same maturity.</p>
<p>These liquidity gaps are based on maturity schedules of balance sheet and off-balance sheet items whether contractual or theoretical, i.e., based on customer behavior (prepayment in the case of loans, modeling customer behavior in the case of regulated savings accounts, etc.).</p>
<p>Regulatory ratios represent the final plank in the liquidity risk management system.</p>
<h2>Risk Mitigation Techniques</h2>
<p>As part of the day-to-day management of liquidity, in the event of a temporary liquidity crisis, the Bank's most liquid assets constitute a financing reserve enabling the Bank to adjust its Treasury position by selling them on the Repo market or discounting them with the central bank. If there is a prolonged liquidity crisis, the Bank may have to gradually reduce its total balance sheet position by selling assets outright.</p>
<p>Less liquid assets may be converted into liquid assets or collateralized as part of the day-to-day management of liquidity.</p>
<p>Liquidity risk is also reduced by the diversification of financing sources in terms of structure, investors, and secured/unsecured financing.</p>
<p>During the current financial year, the Bank continued its policy of diversifying its sources of financing in terms of structures, investors and collateralized financing. The certificate of deposit program offers clients the opportunity to increase their investment in Emirates NBD - Egypt, thereby improving its liquidity.</p>

<h2>4 Significant accounting estimates and assumptions</h2>
<p>In the application of the bank's accounting policies, management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. The following are the key items for which accounting estimates and assumptions have been used.</p>
<h2>(a) Impairment losses on loans and advances (Expected credit loss)</h2>
<p>The Bank reviews its loan and advances portfolios to assess impairment at least on a quarterly basis. In determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in the income statement, the Bank makes judgments as to whether there is any observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a portfolio of loans before the decrease can be identified with an individual loan in that portfolio. This evidence may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a Bank, or national or local Economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the Bank. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective.</p>
<p>Evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows.</p>

<h2>Notes to the for the year ended 31 December 2024</h2>
<p>(In the notes all amounts are presented in thousand Egyptian pound unless otherwise stated)</p>
<h2>(b) Impairment of fair value through other comprehensive income</h2>
<p>The Bank determines that available-for-sale equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost. This determination of what is significant,</p>
<p>Or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates among other factors, the normal volatility in share price. In addition, impairment may be appropriate when there is evidence.</p>
<p>Of a deterioration in the financial health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flows.</p>
<p>The Bank also determines the impairment of investments in debt instruments classified as financial assets at fair value through comprehensive income, guided by the fair value of those instruments, where there is a decline in the fair value of debt instruments at fair value through comprehensive income and an objective evidence that the decline is a The Bank is a The value of a financial asset or a group of financial assets at fair value through comprehensive income is recognized immediately in profit or loss. In the case of impairment of the value of financial assets at fair value through comprehensive income, whether in the form of equity instruments of those instruments, to the profits or losses even if the asset is not excluded from the books after. losses.</p>
<h2>(c) Fair value of derivatives</h2>
<p>The fair values of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair.</p>
<p>Values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are certified before they are used, and models are calibrated to ensure.</p>
<p>That outputs reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities.</p>
<p>And correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect reported fair value of financial instruments. For example, to the extent that management</p>
<h2>(d) Income taxes</h2>
<p>Since the final outcome of income taxes on certain transactions are difficult to determine on an accurate basis, the bank recognizes a liability for the expected results of tax inspection based on its estimate of the likelihood of the additional tax that may arise. When differences arise between the final outcome of income taxes and the amounts previously recognized in the books, such differences will affect current and deferred tax in the year in which those differences have been identified.</p>
<h2>5 Segment analysis</h2>
<h2>(a) By business segment</h2>
<p>C&amp;IB is divided into two segments identified by the level of turnover achieved/expected to be realized by a company. Generally, this segment excludes SMEs identified by an annual turnover of under or equal to EGP 200Mn. Facilities are capped by single / group obligor limits set by the central bank while respecting the buffers agreed per Risk Appetite Statement. The two segments are mainly:</p>

<h2>D- Fair value of financial assets and liabilities</h2>
<p>D/1 Financial instruments measured at fair value using valuation methods</p>
<p>Financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with the change in fair value included in the income statement under the net trading income item. Financial assets classified as fair value through comprehensive income are measured at fair value with the change in fair value included in the statement of comprehensive income under the fair value reserve.</p>
<p>There has been no change in the fair value valuation methods during the current financial year.</p>
<p>The table below shows financial assets and liabilities at fair value in the financial statements within the following hierarchy based on the levels of inputs used to determine the measurements:</p>
<p>Level 1 : Level 1 inputs represent quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for the financial instrument.</p>
<p>Level 2: Level 2 inputs represent inputs other than prices quoted in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable.</p>
<p>Level 3 : Level 3 inputs represent inputs that are unobservable for the financial instruments.</p>

<h2>Balances with banks</h2>
<p>The fair value of balances with banks approximates the book value, as all balances with banks are current balances maturing within one year.</p>
<h2>Investments in securities</h2>
<p>The previous table includes only investments at amortized cost, as financial investments are valued through other comprehensive income at fair value, except for equity instruments whose fair value could not be reliably estimated by the bank. The fair value of financial investments at amortized cost is determined according to the prices announced on the balance sheet date. The difference between the fair value of investments at amortized cost and the book value is due to the change in interest rates.</p>
<h2>Loans and facilities to customers</h2>
<p>Loans and facilities to customers are shown net after deducting the provision for expected credit losses. Loans and facilities to customers are divided into current balances, balances and non-current balances. Management believes that the fair value approximates the book value if the applicable interest rates and the contractual lives of these items are considered.</p>
<h2>Due to banks</h2>
<p>The fair value of due to banks is close to the book value as all due to banks are current balances due within one year.</p>

<h2>18 Financial Derivatives</h2>
<p>The bank uses the following derivatives for hedging and non-hedging purposes: Currency forwards contracts represent commitments to purchase/sell foreign and local currency's including uncompleted portion of the immediate transactions.</p>
<ul>
<li>-Currency or/and interest swap contracts represent the commitments for to swap a group of cash flows to another. These contracts resulted is exchange of currencies or interest rates (for example fixed rate for floating rate) or both (i.e. cross-currency interest rate swaps). No exchange of principal takes place except for certain currency swaps. The Bank's credit risk represents the potential cost to replace the swap contracts if counterparties fail to fulfill their obligation. This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis by comparing it to it's the current fair value and to a percentage of the contract notional amount. To control an existing credit risk the Bank assesses counterparties using the same techniques as for its lending activities.</li>
<li>-Option contracts in foreign currencies and/or interest rates represents contract agreements in which the buyer (issuer) give to seller (holders) a right not an obligation to buy (buy option) or to sell (sell option) at a certain date or within certain year of time by certain amount denominated in foreign currency or a financial instrument with prior agreed price. The buyer receives in return commission against burden of risk he took option contracts are either traded in the market or negotiable between the bank and one of its customers...... The bank exposed to credit risk for the purchased options contracts only and to the extent of its book value which represent its fair value.</li>
<li>-The notional amounts of certain types of financial instrument is used as a basis for comparison purpose with financial instruments recognized on the balance sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows or the current fair value of the instruments and therefore does not indicate the Bank's exposure to credit or price risks.</li>
<li>-The derivative instruments become favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates or foreign exchange rates related to them. The aggregate contractual or notional amount of the existing financial derivative instruments, the duration to which instruments are favorable or unfavorable, and the aggregate fair value of financial assets and liabilities derivatives.</li>
<li>-The bank in general enters into derivatives contracts to cover the foreign currencies positions or the bank interest rates or to fulfill the customers' demands and to cover the risks associated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the bank is not involved in these activities for trade purposes and to generate profits in the short term from the price change, however, all these derivatives are classified as investment held for trading or financial liabilities derivatives, by applying the hedging accounting will not significantly result in enhancing the bank financial performance and its results.</p>
