## Independent auditor's report to the shareholders of Invest bank P.S.C.

## Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

## Our opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Invest bank P.S.C. (the "Bank") and its subsidiaries (together the "Group") as at 31 December 2024, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

## What we have audited

The Group's consolidated financial statements comprise:

- · the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2024;
- · the consolidated statement of profit loss for the year then ended;
- · the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
- · the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
- · the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and
- · the notes to the consolidated financial statements, comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Emphases of matter

We draw attention to the following matters:

- (i) note 2.1 to the consolidated financial statements which states that the Bank has a reimbursement asset of AED 2.1 billion as at 31 December 2024.The realizability of this asset is dependent on the ability of the Group to satisfactorily comply with the eligibility criteria as set out in note 2.1 to enable it to establish an unconditional contractual right to receive amounts due under the reimbursement asset from the Government of Sharjah ("GoS" or the "Guarantor") in accordance with the guarantee agreement entered into with the GoS.
- (ii) note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements which states that the Group continues to focus on a number of initiatives to manage its liquidity and financing requirements in addition to the support provided by the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the GoS.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matters.

## Our audit approach

## Overview

Key Audit

Matters

Management's assessment of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. Measurement of Expected Credit Losses ("ECL").

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we considered where Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.

## Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

## Key audit matter

Management's assessment of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis

Management and the Board of Directors have assessed the appropriateness of the going concern assumption as a basis for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. In performing their assessment, management and the Board of Directors have considered the liquidity requirements of the Group, as well as the liquidity support available from the Central Bank of the UAE ('CBUAE').

As a result of their assessment, which requires making significant assumptions and judgements, management and the Board of Directors have determined that it is appropriate for the consolidated financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis.

The going concern basis for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is considered a key audit matter in view of the significant judgements exercised by management and the assumptions made by it in performing its going concern assessment for the Group.

Refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial Statements.

## Measurement of expected credit losses ("ECL")

The Group applies ECL on all its financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial guarantee contracts including financing commitments and performance guarantees.

The Group exercises significant judgements and makes a number of assumptions in developing its ECL models, which includes probability of default computation separately for retail and corporate portfolios, determining loss given default and exposure at default for both funded and unfunded exposures, forward looking adjustments and staging criteria subject to ECL.

The Group exercises significant judgements and makes a number of assumptions in developing its ECL models, which includes probability of default computation separately for retail and corporate portfolios, determining loss given default and exposure at default for both funded and unfunded exposures, forward looking adjustments and staging criteria subject to ECL.

## How our audit addressed the Key audit matter

We performed the following procedures in respect of the judgements exercised by the Group in performing its going concern assessment:

Confirmed with the CBUAE their ongoing commitment to provide liquidity support for the Bank, as necessary.

Assessed the Group's liquidity requirements, deposit concentration and projected deposit attrition.

Reviewed the reasonableness of management's assumptions and estimates included in the cash flow projections.

Assessed the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in note 2 on management's assessment of the going concern as a basis for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Considered a key audit matter in view of the significant judgements exercised by management and the assumptions made by it in performing its going concern assessment for the Group.

We performed the following audit procedures on the computation and reasonableness of the ECL included in the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024:

We tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation of ECL provision. For a sample of loans, we checked the appropriateness of the Group's application of the staging criteria, including the basis for movement between the stages.

## Key audit matters (continued)

## Key audit matter

Measurement of expected credit losses ("ECL") (continued)

For defaulted exposures, the Group exercises judgements to estimate the expected future cash flows related to individual exposures, including the value of collateral.

The Group's impairment policy under IFRS 9 is presented in Note 4.3.1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Measurement of ECL is considered as a key audit matter as the Group applies significant judgements and makes a number of assumptions in the staging criteria applied to the financial instruments as well as in developing ECL models for calculating in Credit Risk ('SICR') and for estimating forward-looking scenarios.

- · For a sample of exposures, we recomputed the ECL provisions for selected portfolios across different stages to assess mathematical integrity of the ECL computation.
- ➢ We performed an independent credit assessment for a sample of exposures, including stage 3 exposures, by assessing quantitative and qualitative factors, including as necessary, assessment of financial performance of the borrower, source of repayments and its history, credit risk mitigation through discounted cashflows of the borrower including collateral and other relevant risk factors.
- ➢ We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the Group's consolidated financial statements around ECL provisions as required by IFRS Accounting Standards.

## Other information

The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Board of Directors' Report (but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon) which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially mistaken.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Responsibilities of Directors and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements

The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and their preparation in compliance with the applicable provisions of the UAE Federal-Decree Law No. (32) of 2021, Article (114) of the Decretal Federal Law No. (14) of 2018, as amended, and for such internal control as Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

-  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate
-  Provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
-  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
-  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Directors.
-  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis and accounting, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
-  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
-  Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for the purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

## Independent auditor's report to the shareholders of Invest bank P.S.C. (continued)

## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements (continued)

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

As required by the UAE Federal-Decree Law No. (32) of 2021, we report that:

- i) we have obtained all the information we considered necessary for the purposes of our audit;
- ii) the consolidated financial statements have been prepared and comply, in all material respects, with the applicable provisions of the UAE Federal-Decree Law No. (32) of 2021;
- iii) the Group has maintained proper books of account;
- iv) the financial information included in the Board of Directors' report is consistent with the books of account of the Group;
- v) as disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the Group has not purchased or invested in shares during the year ended 31 December 2024;
- vi) note 24 to the consolidated financial statements discloses material related party transactions and the terms under which they were conducted; b) based on the information that has been made available to us, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Group has contravened during the financial year ended 31 December 2024 any of the applicable provisions of the UAE Federal-Decree Law No. (32) of 2021, or in respect of the Group, its Articles of Association which would materially affect its activities or its financial position as at 31 December 2024; and
- viii) note 20.1 to the financial statements discloses the social contributions made during the year ended 31 December 2024.

Further, as required by Article (114) of the Decretal Federal Law No. (14) of 2018, as amended, we report that we have obtained all the information and explanations we considered necessary for the purpose of our audit.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2024

## 1 Legal status and activities

Invest bank P.S.C. ("Invest bank" or "the Bank") is a public shareholding company with limited liability which was incorporated in 1975 by an Emiri Decree issued by His Highness Dr. Sheikh Sultan Bin Mohammed Al Qassimi, Ruler of Sharjah. The registered address of the Bank is at Al Zahra Street, P.O.Box 1885, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates ("UAE").

Invest bank is licensed by the Central Bank of the UAE (the "CBUAE") to carry out banking activities and is principally engaged in the business of corporate and retail banking through its network of branches located in the Emirate of Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Invest bank also carries out banking activities through its branch ("the branch") in Beirut, Lebanon licensed by the Central Bank of Lebanon (the "CB Lebanon"). As a result of the prevailing financial and economic crisis in Lebanon, management has assessed the situation and is proceeding with the liquidation of the branch after having received the CB Lebanon approval to liquidate the branch.

The Bank's shares are listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange ("ADX") and are 70.06% (31 December 2023: 88.11%) owned by the Government of Sharjah as at 31 December 2024.

The Bank has two 100% owned subsidiaries Sharjah Expo Hotel L.L.C., a company engaged in the hotel business and Ethraa Real Estate LLC SP (established on 27 June 2024 a real estate management business. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 comprise the Bank together with both its subsidiaries (together referred to as "the Group").

## 2 Recapitalization and liquidity

## 2.1 Guarantee agreement with GOS

On 10 May 2023, the Bank entered into a guarantee agreement "the guarantee agreement" with the Government of Sharjah "the Guarantor" or "GoS" who is also the ultimate controlling party of the Bank. Pursuant to the terms of the guarantee agreement, the Guarantor has undertaken to protect the Bank against losses in the net book value of specified financial and non-financial assets.

As a condition precedent to the guarantee agreement, one the general assembly approves the increase in share capital through rights issue, the Guarantor shall subscribe to its pro-rata share or all shares offered if not subscribed by other shareholders. The conditions precedent were fulfilled in September 2023 the "effective date" and the guarantee agreement became effective on that date.

The Government of Sharjah subscribed for 230 billion shares and an amount of AED 2.3 billion became payable to the Bank for the participation in the rights issue. The rights issue increased the shareholding of the Government of Sharjah from 50.07% to 88.11%. The Guarantor executed the guarantee agreement as a private act and for commercial purposes at an agreed fee of AED 2.6 billion. The Bank settled the agreed fees payable of AED 2.6 billion by offsetting an amount of AED 2.3 billion against the receivable from the Guarantor arising from the issuance of shares and the remaining amount of AED 0.3 billion was settled through cash paid to Government of Sharjah. The Bank's fee of AED 2.6 billion inconsideration for the Guarantee which was accounted for as a reimbursement asset (note 10).

As per the agreement, the Government of Sharjah shall compensate Invest Bank on all Defaulted Amounts which are caused by a Credit Event under the covered portfolio. The Credit event is defined as an event that occurs when, the guaranteed asset is written off in accordance with the Bank policies or the Bank sells the guarantee obligation at a price below the initial net book value, or balances related to the Lebanon operations are realised at an amount below the initial net book value. Further, the Government shall compensate the Bank on all value losses arising from the non-financial assets when the non-financial asset is disposed or impaired.

for the year ended 31 December 2024

## 2 Recapitalization and liquidity

## 2.1 Guarantee agreement with GOS (continued)

The guarantee agreement is for a period of 5 years from the effective date. The maximum amount that could be claimed over the term of the guarantee is AED 3 billion with a maximum cap of AED 800 million per calendar year. If and to the extent the maximum compensation under the guarantee has not been exhausted at the end of the term of the guarantee, the Bank and the guarantor shall determine the final cash payment by the guarantor to the Bank. Subsequent to any payment notice under the agreement, the guarantor has the right of review to ensure payment notices are in line with the internal policies in all materials respects.

## 2.2 Capital and liquidity

The shareholders of the Bank in General Assembly Meeting held on 27 April 2023 approved the proposed Capital Restructuring Plan (the "Plan"). The relevant regulatory approvals for the Plan had already been obtained prior to the date of Board of Directors meeting held on 25 January 2023. Key features of the Plan are summarised in the following:

- · A guarantee agreement was entered in to with Government of Sharjah "GoS" which is explained above.
- · The Bank shall through the rights issue increase its paid-up share capital by AED 2.6 billion (the "Rights issue) which is to be applied to the settlement of the Guarantee.
- · The impact of the capital restructuring plan on the share capital and equity of the Bank is explained in the statement of changes in equity.

The Bank continues to focus on a number of initiatives to manage its liquidity and financing requirements in addition to the support if required from the CBUAE and GoS. The Board and management believe that the Bank will have the ability to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due.

Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

## 3 Basis of preparation

## (a) Statement of compliance

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and the applicable provisions of UAE Federal Law No. (32) of 2021 which was issued on 20 September 2021 and came into effect on 2 January 2022. IFRS accounting standards comprise accounting standards issued by IASB and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretation Committee ("IFRS IC").

In line with article 309 of Federal Law (32) of 2021, the board of directors shall call a meeting of the General assembly to take a decision on the continuation of the Bank within thirty days of the issuance of these financial statements.

## (b) Basis of measurement

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the measurement of repossessed properties, financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income as these are measured at fair value.

## (c) Functional and presentation currency

This consolidated financial information has been presented in United Arab Emirates ("AED"), which is the Group's functional and presentation currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand unless indicated otherwise.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2024

## 4 Basis of preparation (continued)

## (d) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected.

Significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial information are described as follows:

## (i) Classification of financial assets

In accordance with IFRS, the Group classifies its financial assets based on the assessments of the business models in which the assets are held at a portfolio level and whether cash flows generated by assets constitute solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI"). This requires significant judgement in evaluating how the Group manages its business model and on whether or not a contractual clause in all debt instruments of a certain type breaches SPPI and results in a material portfolio being recorded at fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL").

## (ii) Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance

The measurement of the expected credit loss ("ECL") allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI") is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior (e.g. the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses).

A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:

- -Determining the criteria for significant increase in credit risk ("SICR");
- -Determining the criteria and definition of default;
- -Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;
- -Establishing the number and relative weightings of forward-looking scenarios for each type of product/market and the associated ECL; and
- -Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL.

## (iii) Fair value of unquoted securities

The fair values of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques (such as models) used to determine fair values, these are tested before they are used, and models are calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data, however areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatility and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect reported fair values of financial instruments.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2024

## 3 Basis of preparation (continued)

- (d) Use of estimates and judgements (continued)
- (iv) Repossessed properties

The fair value of repossessed properties were determined by external, independent property valuers, having appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued. The independent valuers provide the fair value of the Group's repossessed properties portfolio annually.

## (v) Reimbursement asset

The Bank's management has considered the following estimates and judgements while developing an appropriate policy for reimbursement asset:

- -The Bank has paid a fee of AED 2.6 billion and the maximum coverage from the guarantee is AED 3 billion.
- -Majority of the loans covered by the guarantee are in stage 3 and the total expected payouts up to the date of signing of the guarantee is substantially equivalent to the fees paid for the guarantee.
- -It is virtually certain that the guarantor will pay the Group on the occurrence of the credit event.

Management is confident that it will be able to meet the eligibility criteria of the guarantee agreement that will establish a contractual right to receive the amounts due as reimbursement asset and that it will be able to fully collect the receivables from the Government of Sharjah in line with the agreement.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2024

## 4 Material accounting policies

The following new and revised applicable IFRS, which became effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024, have been adopted in these consolidated financial statements. The application of these revised IFRSs, except where stated, has not had any material impact on the amounts reported for the current and prior years.

## 4.1 New and revised IFRSs applied on the consolidated financial statements

## Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 - Supplier finance arrangements

The IASB has issued new disclosure requirements about supplier financing arrangements ('SFAs'), after feedback to an IFRS Interpretations Committee agenda decision highlighted that the information required by IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures falls short of meeting user information needs. The objective of the new disclosures is to provide information about SFAs that enables investors to assess the effects on an entity's liabilities, cash flows and the exposure to liquidity risk.

## 4.2 New and revised IFRSs not yet effective and not early adopted

The Group is currently assessing the impact of the below new standards, interpretations and amendments on the future financial statements and intends to adopt these, if applicable, when they become mandatorily effective.

## Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements - IFRS 18

This is the new standard on presentation and disclosure in financial statements, which replaces IAS 1, a focus on updates to the statement of profit or loss.

The key new concepts introduced in IFRS 18 relate to:

- · the structure of the statement of profit or loss with defined subtotals; · requirement to determine the most useful structure summary for presenting expenses in the statement of profit or loss
- · required disclosures in a single note within the financial statements for certain profit or loss performance measures that are reported outside an entity's financial statements (that is, management-defined performance measures); and
- · enhanced principles on aggregation and disaggregation which apply to the primary financial statements and notes in general

## Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures - IFRS 19

This new standard works alongside other IFRS Accounting Standards. An eligible subsidiary applies the requirements in other IFRS Accounting Standards except for the disclosure requirements; and it applies instead the reduced disclosure requirements in IFRS 19. IFRS 19's reduced disclosure requirements balance the information needs of the users of eligible subsidiaries' financial statements with cost savings for preparers. IFRS 19 is a voluntary standard for eligible subsidiaries. A subsidiary is eligible if it does not have public accountability, and it has an ultimate or intermediate parent that produces consolidated financial statements available for public use that comply with IFRS Accounting Standards.

## 1 January 2027

This is the new standard on presentation and disclosure in financial statements, which replaces IAS 1, a focus on updates to the statement of profit or loss.

The key new concepts introduced in IFRS 18 relate to:

- · the structure of the statement of profit or loss with defined subtotals;
- · requirement to determine the most useful structure summary for presenting expenses in the statement of profit or loss
- · required disclosures in a single note within the financial statements for certain profit or loss performance measures that are reported outside an entity's financial statements (that is, management-defined performance measures); and
- · enhanced principles on aggregation and disaggregation which apply to the primary financial statements and notes in general

- 4 Material accounting policies (continued)
- 4.3 Accounting policies
- (a) Financial assets and liabilities
- 1. Measurement
- 1.1 Amortised cost and effective interest rate

The amortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition; minus the principal repayments; plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest rate method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance.

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset i.e. its amortised cost before any impairment allowance or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. The calculation does not consider expected credit losses and includes transaction costs, premiums or discounts and fees paid or received that are integral to the effective interest rate, such as origination fees.

When the Group revises the estimates of future cash flows, the carrying amount of the respective financial asset or financial liability is adjusted to reflect the new estimate discounted using the original effective interest rate. Any changes are recognised in the statement of income.

- 1.2 Interest income

Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of financial assets, except for financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired, for which interest income is calculated by effective interest rate to their amortised cost (i.e. net of the expected credit loss provision).

- 1.3 Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transactions costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability, such as fee and commissions. Transactions costs of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Immediately after initial recognition, an ECL is recognised for financial assets measured at amortised cost and at FVTOCI, which results in accounting loss being recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when an asset is newly originated.

When the fair value of financial assets and liabilities differs from the transaction price on initial recognition, the entity recognises the difference as follows:

- -When the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (i.e. a level 1 input) or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the difference is recognised as a gain or loss.
- -In all other cases, the difference is deferred, and the time of recognition of deferred day one profit or loss is determined individually. It is either amortised over the life of the instrument, deferred until the instrument's fair value can be determined using market observable inputs, or realised through settlement.

- 4 Material accounting policies (continued)
- 4.3 Accounting policies (continued)
- (a) Financial assets and liabilities
- 2 Financial assets

Debt instruments:

Debt instruments are those instruments that meet the definition of financial liability from the issuer's perspective,

- -the Group's business model for managing the asset's assets; and
- -the cash flow characteristics of the asset.

-Based these factors, the Group classifies its debt instruments into one of the following three measurement categories:

- -Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest ('SPPI'), and that are not designated at FVTPL, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of these assets is adjusted by any expected credit loss allowance recognised and measured. Interest income from these financial assets is included in 'Interest income' using the effective interest rate method.
- -Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI): Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, and that are not designated at FVTPL, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
- -Movements in carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains and losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instruments' amortised cost which are recognised in the statement of income. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the statement of income and recognised in 'Other income'. Interest income from these financial assets is included in 'Interest income' using the effective interest rate method.
- (i) Classification and subsequent measurement
- -Fair value through profit or loss: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented in the statement of income within 'Other income' in the period in which it arises. Interest income from these financial assets is included in 'Interest income' using the effective interest rate method.

- 2. Financial assets (continued)
- (i) Classification and subsequent measurement (continued)
- 5. Business model: the business model reflects how the Group manages the assets in order to generate cash flows. That is, whether the Group's objective is solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the assets or to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows arising from the sale of assets. If neither of these is applicable (e.g. financial assets are held for trading purposes), then the financial assets are classified as part of 'other' business models and measured at FVTPL. Factors considered by the Group in determining the business model for a group of assets include past experience on how the cash flows for these assets were collected, how the asset's performance is evaluated and reported to key management personnel, how risks are assessed and managed and how managers are compensated.
- 6. SPPI: Where the business model is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or to collect contractual cash flows and sell, the Group assesses whether financial instruments' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (the "SPPI test"). In making this assessment, the Group considers whether contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and an interest rate that is consistent with basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The Group reclassifies investment in debt instruments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. The reclassification takes place from the start of the first reporting period following the change. Such changes are expected to be very infrequent, and none occurred during the period.

## Equity instruments

Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer's perspective; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual interest in the issuer's net assets. Examples of equity instruments include basic ordinary shares.

The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Group's management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Group's policy is to designate equity investments as FVTOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than to generate investment returns. When this election is used, fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the statement of income, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as other income when the Group's right to receive payments is established.

## Cash and cash equivalents

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, balances with central banks, amounts due from other banks that are held for the purpose of meeting short term cash commitments.

Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost in the statement of financial position.

## Loans and advances to customers

Loans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments, that are not quoted in an active market and the Group does not intend to sell immediately in the near future.

Loans and advances are initially measured at fair value plus incremental direct transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition loans and advances are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except when the Group recognises the loans and advances at fair value through profit or loss.

## Investment securities

Investment securities are initially measured at fair value plus in case of investment securities not at fair value through profit or loss, incremental direct transaction cost. Subsequent to initial recognition investment securities are accounted for depending upon their classification as either amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income.

Investment securities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, if:

- -they are held within a business model with an objective to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flow and the contractual terms of financial assets give rise, on specific dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest; and
- -they have not been designated previously as measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The Group elects to present changes in fair value of certain investments in equity and debt instruments held for strategic purpose in other comprehensive income. The election is irrevocable and is made on an instrument-byinstrument basis at initial recognition.

Gains and losses on such equity instruments are not reclassified to consolidated statement of profit or loss and no impairment is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

- 4 Material accounting policies (continued)

- (ii)
- Impairment
- The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECL associated with its debt instrument assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI and with the exposure arising from loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:
- -An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- -The time value of money; and
- -Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
- (iii) Modification of loans

The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to customers. When this happens, the Group assesses whether or not the new terms are substantially different to the original terms. The Group does this by considering, among others, the following factors:

- -If the borrower is in financial difficulty, whether the modification merely reduces the contractual cash flows to amounts the borrower is expected to be able to pay.
- -Whether any substantial new terms introduced, such as a profit share/equity-based return that substantially affects the risk profile of the loan.
- -Significant extension of the loan term when the borrower is not in financial difficulty.
- -Significant change in the interest rate.
- -Change in the currency the loan is denominated in.
- -Insertion of collateral, other security or credit enhancements that significantly affect the credit risk associated with the loan.

If the terms are substantially different, the Group derecognises the original financial asset and recognises a 'new' asset at fair value and recalculates a new effective interest rate for the asset. The date of renegotiation is consequently considered to be the date of initial recognition for impairment calculation purposes, including for the purpose of determining whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. However, the Group also assesses whether the new financial asset recognised is deemed to be credit-impaired at initial recognition, especially in circumstances where the renegotiation was driven by the debtor being unable to make the originally agreed payments. Differences in the carrying amount are also recognised in the statement of income as a gain or loss on derecognition.

If the terms are not substantially different, the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition, and the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount based on the revised cash flows of the financial asset and recognises a modification gain or loss in the statement of income.

The new gross carrying amount is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate.

- 4 Material accounting policies (continued)
- 4.3 Accounting policies (continued)
- (a) Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
- 2. Financial assets (continued)
- (iv) Derecognition other than on a modification
- Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised or the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and either (i) the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownerships, or (ii) the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the Group has not retained control.

The Group enters into transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows from assets assume a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards. These transactions are accounted for as 'pass through' transfers that result in derecognition if the Group:

- -Has no obligation to make payments unless it collects equivalent amounts from the assets;
- -Is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and
- -Has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material delay.

## 3. Financial liabilities

- (i) Classification and subsequent measurement

In both the current and prior period, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for:

- -Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: this classification is applied to derivatives, financial liabilities held for trading (eg. Short positions in the trading booking) and other financial liabilities designated as such at initial record consumption. Gains or losses on financial liabilities designated at FVTPL presented partially in other comprehensive income (the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability, which is determined as the amount that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk) and partially profit or loss (the remaining amount of change in the fair value of the fair liability). This is unless a presentation would create, or enlarge, an accounting mismatch, in which case the gains and losses attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability are also presented in the statement of income;
- -Financial liabilities arising from the transfer of financial assets which did not qualify for derecognition whereby financial liability is recognised for the consideration received for the transfer. In subsequent periods, the Group recognises any expense incurred on the financial liability; and
- -Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments.

- (ii)
- Deregonsition

Financial liabilities are deregonsed when they are extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, canceled or expires).

The exchange between the Group and its original lenders of debt instruments with substantially different terms, as well as substantial modifications of the terms of existing financial liabilities, are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. In addition, other qualitative factors, such as the currency that the instrument is denominated in, changes in the type of interest rate, new conversion features attached to the instrument and change in the covenants are also taken into consideration.

If an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognized as part of the gain or loss on extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is not

accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are

amortized over the remaining term of the modified liability.

## 4. Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and others on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities.

- -The maximum of the loss allowance; and
- -The premium received on initial recognition less income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

## 5. Loan commitments

Loan commitments provided by the Group are measured as the amount of the loss allowance. The Group has not made any commitment to provide loans at a below-market interest rate, or that can be settled net in cash or by delivering or issuing another financial instrument.

For loan commitments, the loss allowance is recognised as a provision. However, for contracts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment and the Group cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment component from those on the loan component, the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment are recognised together with the loss allowance for the loan. To the extent that the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross carrying amount of the loan, the expected credit losses are recognised as a provision.

## INVEST BANK P.S.C.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2024

- 4 Material accounting policies (continued)
- 4.3 Accounting policies (continued)
- (e) Offsetting

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRSs, or for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group's trading activity.

## (f) Fair value measurement principles

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date.  The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.

When available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument.  A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price - i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received.  If the Group determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price.  Subsequently, that difference is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data, or the transaction is closed out.

If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the Group measures assets and long positions at bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price.

Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are exposed to market risk and credit risk that are managed by the Group on the basis of the net exposure to either market or credit risk are measured on the basis of a price that would be received to sell a net long position (or paid to transfer a net short position) for a particular risk exposure.  Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual assets and liabilities on the basis of the relative risk adjustment of each of the individual instruments in the portfolio.

The fair value of a demand deposit is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be required to be paid.

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the change occurred.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2024

- 4 Material accounting policies (continued)
- 4.3 Accounting policies (continued)
- (g) Derivative financial instruments - Other non-trading derivatives

The Group enters into derivative financial instruments primarily to meet its customer requirements. Derivatives held for internal risk management purposes include all derivative assets and liabilities that are not classified as trading assets or liabilities. Derivatives held for risk management purposes are measured at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated statement of financial position.

## (h) Foreign currency

- (i) Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to UAE Dirhams at the foreign exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to UAE Dirhams at the spot foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.  The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the amortised cost in UAE Dirhams at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortised cost in the foreign currency translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the year.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated to UAE Dirhams at the spot exchange rate at the date on which the fair value is determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency differences arising from translation are generally recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss.

## (ii) Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into UAE Dirhams at spot exchange rate on the reporting date.  The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to UAE Dirhams at spot exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve), except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to non-controlling interest ("NCI").

When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI.

If the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, then foreign currency differences arising on the item form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the translation reserve within equity.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2024

- 4 Material accounting policies (continued)
- 4.3 Accounting policies (continued)
- (i) Property and equipment
- (i) Recognition and measurement

Items of property and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated

- (ii) Subsequent cost

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits of the expenditure will flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

- (iii) Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their useful lives and is generally recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss. Land is not depreciated.

The estimated useful lives of significant items of property and equipment are as follows:

|                                       | Years    |
|---------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                             | 20 to 30 |
| Office installations and improvements | 10       |
| Office furniture and equipment        | 2 to 5   |
| Right of use assets                   | Up to 4  |

Depreciation  methods,  useful  lives  and  residual  values  are  reassessed  at  the  reporting  date  and  adjusted  if appropriate.  No  depreciation  is  charged  on  free  land  held  and  capital-work-in-progress.  Gains  and  losses  on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

## (j) Repossessed properties

The Group holds repossessed properties acquired through the enforcement of security over loans and advances. Repossessed property is measured at cost on initial recognition and subsequently at fair value with any change therein recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The Group determines fair value on the basis of valuations provided by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the possessed property being valued. The Bank earns rental income from leasing the properties until the properties have been disposed.

## (k) Staff terminal benefits

The Group  provides  for  staff  terminal  benefits  based  on  an  estimation  of  the  amount  of  future  benefit  that employees have earned in return for their service until their retirement. This calculation is performed based on a projected unit credit method.

The Group contributes to the pension scheme for UAE nationals under the UAE pension and social security law. This is a defined contribution pension plan and the Group's contributions are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the period to which they relate. In respect of this scheme, the Group has a legal and constructive obligation to pay the fixed contributions as they fall due and no obligation exists to pay the future benefits.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2024

- 4 Material accounting policies (continued)
- 4.3 Accounting policies (continued)
- (i) Provisions

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

## (m) Financial guarantees and loan commitments

Financial guarantees are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.  Loan  commitments  are  firm  commitments  to  provide  credit  under  pre-specified  terms  and conditions.

Liabilities arising from financial guarantees or commitments to provide a loan at a below-market interest rate are initially  measured  at  fair  value  and  the  initial  fair  value  is  amortised  over  the  life  of  the  guarantee  or  the commitment. The liability is subsequently carried at the higher of this amortised amount and the present value of any expected payment to settle the liability when a payment under the contract has become probable. Financial guarantees and commitments to provide a loan at a below-market interest rate are included within other liabilities.

## (n) Earnings per share

The Group presents  basic  and  diluted  earnings  per  share  ("EPS")  data  for  its  ordinary  shares.  Basic  EPS  is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

## (o) Dividend on ordinary shares

Dividends payable on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the Bank's shareholders.

## (p) Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

## (q) Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than investment property, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. The reduction in value is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

for the year ended 31 December 2024

- 4 Material accounting policies (continued)

- (r) Segment reporting

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the management of the Group to make decisions about resources allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.

## (s) Reimbursement asset (Purchased Financial Guarantee premium)

Purchased financial guarantees are irrevocable contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of the guarantee for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantees which are purchased sometime later after the origination of the financial assets are not an integral part of the financial assets and are not considered when computing the expected credit loss of the guaranteed financial asset.

The financial guarantee held by the holder is not an integral part of the financial asset and hence is outside the scope of IFRS 9- Financial Instruments, IFRS 17- Insurance contracts. Hence, in line with the requirements of IAS 8Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the Bank has accounted for the financial guarantee under IAS 37. Having considered the above facts, the premium paid for the guarantee has been recognised as a reimbursement asset. Subsequently, the reimbursement asset will be measured with reference to the expected payouts and credit losses. In assessing the expected payouts and credit losses, the Group considers various scenarios of forecast recoveries and expected cash flows from claims under the guarantee, which are then discounted to arrive at the present value of these future cash flows in comparison to the reimbursement asset held at the period end. When the Credit Event has occurred and the Group has a contractual right to receive compensation, the reimbursement right is derecognised and receivable from the Government is recognised at fair value.

## 10 Reimbursement asset

A guarantee agreement was entered into with Government of Sharjah "GoS" whereby, the Government of Sharjah shall compensate Invest Bank on all Defaulted Amounts which are caused by a Credit Event as explained in note 2.1 of the consolidated financial statements. During 2023, the Bank paid a fee of AED 2.6 billion in consideration for the Guarantee. During the year, the Bank collected AED 531.5 million from the Government of Sharjah in line with the settlement period under the agreement reducing the outstanding balance to AED 2.1 billion as at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: AED 2.6 billion). Subsequent to the statement of financial position date, the Bank  submitted  payment  notices  amounting  to  AED  153.3  million  to  the  Government  of  Sharjah  for reimbursement which were received in line with the settlement period under the agreement.

## 11 Subsidiary held for sale

As at 31 December 2023, additional assets pertaining to Sharjah Expo Hotel L.L.C., fully owned subsidiary of the  bank  that  was  acquired  as  a  settlement  of  debt,  totaling  to  AED  78  million,  qualified  for  held  for  sale classification under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and are measured at the lower of their respective carrying amounts and fair value less costs to sell.

According to IFRS 5, the classification as asset held for sale condition is considered as met only when the sale is highly  probable,  and  the  non-current  asset  (or  disposal  group)  is  available  for  immediate  sale  in  its  present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. Due to the market conditions, management was not able to sell the asset during the 12 month period, hence the asset ceased to be classified as held for sale as of 31 December 2024.

## INVEST BANK P.S.C.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2024

## 16 Share capital

## 16.1 Share capital (continued)

At the General Assembly ("GA") meeting held on 27 April 2023 the proposed Capital Restructuring Plan (the "Plan") was approved. The relevant regulatory approvals for the plan had already been obtained prior to the date of Board of Directors meeting held on 25 January 2023.

The shareholders resolved during the GA Meeting and following receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals to approve the three-step Capital Restructuring Plan which consists of the following measures:

- a. reduction of the share capital of AED 3,180,982,143 by AED2,578,489,214 by writing off Invest Bank's accumulated losses of AED 2,100,632,071 and the existing share discount amount of AED 477,857,143, which shall be effected through reducing the nominal value of each share from AED1 to AED0.1894046876, resulting in a total share capital of AED 602,492,929 (the "First Reduction");
- b. after effecting the First Reduction, increasing the share capital of Invest Bank by AED 49,245,218,776 (the "Capital Increase"), by issuing 260,000,000,000 shares (the "New Shares") at an Issue Price of AED 0.01(1 Fils) (the "Issue Price"), implying a discount of AED 0.1794046876 on the Subscription Price of each share. This would result in a share discount amount on the shareholders' equity of AED 46,645,218,776. The total share capital of the Bank will become AED 49,847,711,705 distributed over 263,180,982,143 shares; and
- c. after effecting the First Reduction and the Capital Increase, a further reduction in the share capital of InvestBank by writing off an amount equal to the share discount of AED 46,645,218,776 referred to in paragraph(b), resulting in a share capital after the Capital Restructuring Plan of AED 3,202,492,929 at a nominal value of AED 0.012168406 (the "Second Reduction").

## 16.2 Share discount

During 2023, share discount amounting AED 477.9 million was written off against the share capital as part of the "First Reduction" (Step 1) of the Capital Restructuring Plan. A further discount on the second increase in capital of AED 46.645 billion has also been written off against the increase in capital of AED 49,245 billion.

## 16.3 Impairment reserve - general

As per the new credit risk management standards (CRMS) issued by CBUAE, banks must ensure that the total provision corresponding to all stage 1 and stage 2 exposures is not less than 1.50% of the credit risk weighted assets as computed under the CBUAE capital regulations. Where the collective provisions held are lower, the shortfall may be held in a dedicated non-distributable balance sheet reserve called the "impairment reserve" general. The amount held in the impairment reserve-general must be deducted from the capital base (Tier 1 capital for banks) when computing the regulatory capital.

The computation of non-distributable impairment reserve - general created during the year is as follows:

| AED'000                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 75,368                                                                        |
| 147,987                                                                       |
| Shortfall in stage 1 and stage 2 provision to meet minimum CBUAE requirements |
| -                                                                             |

| Liquidity requirements to support calls under guarantees and standby letters of credit are considerably less than the amount of the commitment because the Group does not generally expect third parties to draw funds under the agreement.  The total  outstanding  contractual  amount  of  commitments  to  extend  credit  does  not  necessarily represent future cash requirements, as many of these commitments will expire or terminate without being funded.   |

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2024

## 28 Fair value of assets and liabilities

## Fair value of assets and liabilities (continued)

- (a) Fair value hierarchy of assets/liabilities measured at fair value

The fair values of assets and liabilities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations. For all other assets/liabilities, the Group determines fair values using other valuation techniques. For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees of judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument.

## Valuation of investment securities

The Bank constantly monitors the progress of its investments by conducting its own valuation assessment. Depending on the nature of the underlying asset, quantitative methods are used such as residual value, discounted cash flow ("DCF")/scenario analysis or comparable market valuation. The unobservable inputs are selected based on various industry and macroeconomic factors that management considers as reasonable. Qualitative methods which involve taking into consideration the market and economic outlook are also employed.

## Valuation of repossessed properties

The fair values of repossessed properties were determined by external, independent property valuers, having appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued. The independent valuers provide the fair value of the Group's repossessed properties portfolio annually.

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.

Level 1: Quoted market price (unadjusted) in an active market for an identical instrument.

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.

Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.

Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, comparison with similar instruments for which market observable prices exist. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk-free and benchmark interest rates, credit spreads and other premia used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity and equity index prices and expected price volatilities and correlations.

The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

Although the Bank believes that its estimates at fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value. For fair value measurement in level-3, changing an assumption by 5% (+/-), would not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

## 29 Risk management

Introduction and overview

The key objective of the Bank is to manage risk and provide

risk-adjusted returns to the shareholders in line with

the accepted risk levels. Risk is inherent in the Bank's activity and is managed through a process of ongoing risk identification, measurement, and monitoring by setting risk limits and controls. The Bank has established comprehensive risk frameworks and governance structure for managing all material risks. The framework addresses the risk processes of all material risks across the bank. The Risk management direction is set right at the top of the Board of Directors ("BOD") and implements the risk management governance structure and framework. Monitoring and controlling risk is primarily performed based on limits established by the bank through business and risk strategy as well as the level of risk that the bank is willing to accept.

To achieve this, the Bank has adopted the Three Lines Of Defense approach to manage its risk effectively. The First Line of Defense (FLOD) consists of revenue generating units, components, and their enabling functions, (Front Office and their Support functions). The FLOD teams are responsible for their risk factors and conductive control environment in their business unit and activities and implement policies and procedures in line with the Group's risk appetite. The Second Line of Defense (SLOD) is made up of risk management and compliance functions. The SLOD teams are responsible for risk management development, oversight monitoring process and the implementation of the Group's overall risk management. The Third Line of Defense is implemented by auditors (internal auditors and external auditor). The third line of defense is independent of both the FLOD and SLOD and are responsible for assessing the effectiveness of both the FLOD and SLOD in terms of Control adequacy of the Bank. Auditors report their findings directly to the Board of Directors as an assurance function.

The Group has exposure to several risk categories, and it has frameworks to cover all material risks across the Bank, in addition to the following primary risks: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk Operational risk

The other distinct risks assessed by the Bank are concentration, business / strategic, regulatory, compliance, reputation, Technology and legal risks. Furthermore, information security risk is a critical risk in the current business environment and the Bank has put in place a robust infrastructure to manage the risk.

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above primary risks, the Group's objectives, risk management frameworks, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks, and the Group's capital management plan.

## Governance and Risk Management Framework (RMF)

The Board of Directors (the "Board" or "BOD") has the ultimate responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's Risk Management Framework. For that purpose, the Board has formulated, in line with the best international practices, the following committees at Board level to help manage various risks the Bank faces:

- a. Board Audit &amp; Compliance Committee;
- b. Board Risk Committee;
- c. Board Credit Committee;
- d. Board Nomination and Remuneration Committee.
- e. Board Real Estate Committee
- f. Strategy and Transformation Committee
- g. Board Special Assets Committee

Introduction and overview (continued)

The Board Risk Committee has been entrusted with the mandate of risk management and the Board Credit Committee has been entrusted with the approval of the credit and investment decisions as per delegation from the Board of Directors.

The various Board Committees are assisted by the following Senior Management Committees: Asset Liability Committee (ALCO), Risk Committee (RC), Management Credit Committee (MCC), Special Assets and Provision Committee (SAP), Model Oversight Committee (MOC), and Operation Risk and Information Risk Committee.

The Bank has implemented the Basel III Framework, IFRS 9 and has established other specific committees / working groups with assigned responsibilities to members of the senior management.

Regular audit of business units and credit processes are undertaken by Internal Audit. Furthermore, Control and Compliance functions have also been enhanced. The Risk Management function is led by Chief Risk Officer (CRO), which comprises of Enterprise Risk, Credit Risk, Credit Administration, Operational Risk, Fraud Risk and investigations, Market and Liquidity risk management, Information security and Portfolio Management. Under the purview of the Risk Management Department, the Group's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework enables the business and functional units to manage all risks in a pro-active manner while integrating concepts of strategic planning, operational risk management, internal controls, and compliance. These include methods and processes, encompassing all dimensions to seize the opportunities related to the achievement of the Group's objectives.

The Risk framework consists of policy documents covering all material risks across the Bank, which include ERM policy, Risk Appetite, Credit Policies, IFRS 9 Impairment Policy, Market and Liquidity Risk related policies, Operational Risk Management Policy, Fraud Risk and Investigation Policy, Information Security risk related policies, BCM Policy, Reputation Risk Policy, Country Risk Framework, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") Policy, etc.

Credit Department (CDT) has formulated credit underwriting policies aligned with Group's strategies, goals-a-vis risk appetite, including collateral management policies, credit assessment, risk grading and reporting, risk rating in compliance with regulatory requirements.

The Bank has a Board Approved Risk Appetite Statement (the "RAS") with threshold limits and benchmarks clearly defined and monitored monthly with update management and the Board. The RAS has been cascaded at Business Unit levels to ensure effective monitoring.

Review of risk management policies and systems is a continuous activity to reflect changes in market conditions, products and services offered by the Group in order to present a comprehensive view of risk from a strategic and operational perspective and have a process to address risk proactively. Bank is currently undergoing strategic transformation which will prepare the Bank for the next phase of growth. As a result, the Risk Management Framework is also being enhanced to adequately support the implementation of the strategy and mitigate the risks arising out of the same.

(a) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group's loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities, balances due from banks, Deposits and reserve with the Central Bank excluding cash on hand, other assets and debt securities.s

## Management of credit risk

The Board of Directors has delegated the responsibilities of the management of credit to Risk Board Committee (BCC), Management Credit Committee (MCC) and Special Assets and provision Committee (SAP). Changes to discretionary limits are subject to the Board's approval. Similarly, facilities in excess of discretionary limits are approved by the BCC or and the Board of Directors. In addition, the delegation of authority is aligned with New Credit Risk Management Standards.

A centralized credit management Department ("CDT") is responsible for oversight of the Group's credit underwriting activities including credit assessment and evaluation. The Bank has also established Credit Risk function within Risk Management Department, which is responsible for oversight and monitoring of groups credit risk activities while ensuring that such risks are within the Board approved Risk Appetite Statement, Policies and Frameworks. In addition, the Bank has established Credit Administration Division (CAD) as a control unit responsible for credit administration and documentation as well as a Central Credit Operations (CCO) unit to centralize credit operations encompassing, amongst others, activities like validation, settlement and utilization of limits.

## The broad functions of CDT include:

- -Formulating credit policies in consultation with business units, covering credit assessment, collateral requirements, risk grading and reporting, documentary and legal procedures, and compliance with regulatory and statutory requirements;
- -Reviewing and assessing credit risk in accordance with delegation &amp; authority structure, limits and discretionary powers prior to facilities being committed to customers. Renewals and reviews of facilities are subject to the same rigorous review process;
- -Limiting concentrations of credit exposure to counterparties and industries in line with the RAS by establishing exposure caps and monitoring sectoral exposures. Preferred sectors are identified and reviewed regularly in line with market dynamics.
- -Reviewing compliance on an ongoing basis with approved exposure limits relating to counterparties, group caps including Board exposure caps, industries and countries. Regular reports are provided to the management, MCC, BCC and the Board of Directors on the quality of portfolios, breaches, if any and appropriate corrective action is initiated when necessary; and
- -Providing advice, guidance and specialized training to business units to promote best practices throughout the Group in the management of credit risk.

For financial institutions, the Group uses external ratings issued by Standard and Poor's, Moody's, Fitch, Capital Intelligence or other recognised credit rating agencies in order to manage its credit risk exposure.

The Group has adopted the 'Standardized Approach' for computation of credit risk and market Risk weighted Assets while uses 'Basic Indicator Approach' for Operational Risk, in line with Central Bank regulations. Models for Internal Risk Rating, categorizing the exposures according to the degree of risk of default have been developed and are in use since 2012. The current risk grading framework consists of main eight grades reflecting varying degrees of risk of default and mitigation through collateral or other credit risk mitigants.

Group introduced online processing of credit applications and rating of all counterparties. The estimation of credit exposure for risk management purposes is complex and requires the use of models, as exposure varies with changes in market conditions, expected cash flows and the passage of time. The assessment of credit risk of a portfolio of assets entails further estimations as to the likelihood of defaults occurring and of the associated loss ratios for counterparties. The Group measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). This is the approach used for the purposes of

## Use of estimates and judgements

The Bank exercises significant judgement in assessing and estimating areas such as Expected Credit Losses. Given the uncertainty and limited forward looking information, the Bank has taken the approach of implementing a judgmental overlay to the ECL model by changing its macroeconomic weightages. The Group uses the weightings of (20: 60: 20) for Baseline: Downturn: Upside scenarios.

## Governance around IFRS 9 ECL models and calculations

Given the significant impact that the macro-economic scenarios and weightages will have on the Bank's Expected Credit Losses, the Bank has further strengthened its processes, controls and governance frameworks around macro-economic forecasting and the computation of Expected Credit Losses. In line with Model Management Standards and Guidelines, Bank has constituted Model Oversight committee which reviews the inputs and assumptions for IFRS 9 ECL in light of available information.

## 29 Risk management (continued)

- (a) Credit risk (continued)

## Credit risk grading

The Group uses internal credit risk grading's that reflect its assessment of the probability of default of individual counterparties. The rating models are tailored to various asset classes. Borrower and loan specific information collected at the time of application (such as disposable income, and level of collateral for retail exposures; and turnover and industry type for wholesale exposures) is fed into this rating model. This is supplemented with external data input into the model.

The credit grades are calibrated such that risk of default increases exponentially at each higher risk grade. For example, this means that the difference in the PD between an A and A- rating grade is lower than the difference in the PD between a B and B- rating grade.

The following are additional considerations for each type of portfolio held by the Group:

## Retail:

After the initial recognition of credit grade, for retail business, the repayment behavior of the borrower is monitored to establish the grade of the customer based on the stage of delinquency/account conduct.

## Corporate:

For corporate business, the rating is determined at the borrower level. Relationship managers incorporate any updated or new information/credit assessments into the credit system on an ongoing basis. In addition, relationship managers also update information about the creditworthiness of the borrower every year from sources such as financial statements. This determines the updated internal credit rating and PD. Duly authorized overrides are applied on the ratings when the actual performance of the borrower does not align with the model output.

## Treasury:

For investments in debt instruments, external rating agency credit grades are used. These published grades are continuously monitored and updated. The PD's associated with each grade are determined based on realised default rates over the prior 12 months, as published by the rating agency.

## (i) Expected credit loss measurement

- IFSR 9 outlines a 'three-stage' model for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition as summarized below:
- -A financial instrument that is not credit-impaired on initial recognition is classified in 'Stage 1' and has its credit risk continuously monitored by the Group.
- -If a significant increase in credit risk ('SICR') since initial recognition is identified, the financial instrument is moved to 'Stage 2' but is not yet deemed to be credit-impaired.
- -If the financial instrument is credit-impaired or de livent for more than 90 days, the financial instrument is then moved to 'Stage 3'.
- -Financial assets in Stage 1 have their ECL measured at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime expected credit losses that result from default events possible within the next 12 months. Instruments in Stages 2 or 3 have their ECL measured based on expected credit losses from all possible default events over the lifetime.
- -A pervasive concept in measuring the ECL in accordance with IFRS 9 is that it should consider forwardlooking information.

## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

The Group considers a financial asset to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk when one or more of the following quantitative, qualitative or backstop criteria have been met:

## Quantitative criteria

For corporate loans, if the borrower experiences a significant increase in probability of default which can be triggered by the following quantitative factors:

- A credit risk rating (CRR) downgrade of 2 or more notches is considered significant in case the origination rating is below BBB+, hence the related facility shall be classified at Stage 2. Facilities with rating movement between AAA+ and A- are not subject to this criterion on account of low credit risk.
- If the origination rating is B+ (6+) and below (inclusive), a CRR downgrade of 1 or more notches is considered significant, hence the related facility shall be classified at Stage 2 since the movement of related PD is higher.
- Loan facilities restructured/rescheduled in the last 12 months;
- Loan facilities that are past due for 30 days and above but less than 90 days;
- Any facility of a performing customer being Stage 3.

## Retail:

For Retail portfolio, if the borrowers meet one or more of the following criteria:

- Loan rescheduling before 30 days past due;
- Accounts overdue between 30 and 90 days.

## Treasury:

Significant increase in probability of default of the underlying treasury instrument;

- Significant change in the financial instruments' expected performance and behavior of borrower.

## Qualitative criteria:

For corporate loans, if the borrowers experience a significant increase in probability of default, which can be triggered by the following qualitative factors:

- Net worth erosion
- Fraudulent activity
- Distressed restructure
- Financial covenants breach
- Significant operations disruption
- Bad news in public domain
- Significant reputation damage
- Subject to material litigation

## Backstop:

A backstop is applied and the financial asset considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk if the borrower is more than 30 days past due on its contractual payments.

## Definition of default and credit-impaired assets

The Group defines a financial instrument as in default, which is fully aligned with the definition of credit-impaired, when it meets one or more of the following criteria:

## Quantitative criteria:

The obligor is more than 90 days past due on its contractual obligation to the Group.

## Qualitative criteria:

The Group considers a default to have occurred with regard to particular obligors when either one of the following events have taken place:

- -The Group considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligation to the Group in full without recourse by the Group to actions like realizing security (if held).
- -The Group puts the credit obligation on a non-accrual status.
- -The Group makes a charge-off or account-specific provision resulting from a perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the Bank taking on the exposure.
- -The Group sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss.
- -The Group consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by material forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest and other fees.
- -The Group has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or similar order in respect of the obligor's credit obligation to the Group.

The criteria above have been applied to all financial instruments held by the Group and are consistent with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes. The default definition has been applied consistently to model the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD) throughout the Group's expected loss calculations.

An instrument is considered to no longer be in default (i.e. to have cured) when it no longer meets any of the default criteria for a consecutive period of twelve months.

## Measuring ECL - Inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques

ECL is measured on either a 12-month (12M) or lifetime basis depending on whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. Expected credit losses are the discounted product of the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD), defined as follows:

- -PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation (as per 'Definition of default and credit-impaired' above), either over the next 12 months (12M PD), or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation.
- -EAD represents the expected exposure at the time of default based on the amounts the Group is expecting to be owed at the time of default, over the next 12 months (12M EAD) or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime EAD). For example, for a revolving commitment, the Group includes the current drawn balance plus any further amount that is expected to be drawn up to the current contractual limit by the time of default, should it occur.

## Measuring ECL - Inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques (continued)

- -Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the Group's expectation of the extent of loss on a defaulted exposure. LGD varies by type of counterparty, type and seniority of claim and availability of collateral or other credit support. LGD is expressed as a percentage loss per unit of exposure at the time of default (EAD).

The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each quarterly period and for each individual exposure or collective segment. These three components are multiplied together and adjusted for the likelihood of survival (i.e. the exposure has not prepaid or defaulted in previous period). This effectively calculates an ECL for each future month, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed. The discount rate used in the ECL calculation is the original effective interest rate on an approximation thereof.

The lifetime PD is developed by applying a maturity profile to the current 12M PD. The maturity profile looks at how defaults develop on a portfolio from the point of initial recognition throughout the lifetime of the loans. The maturity profile is based on historical observed data and is assumed to be the same across all assets within a portfolio and credit grade band. This is supported by historical analysis.

The 12-month and lifetime EADs are determined based on the expected payment profile, which varies by product type:

- -For amortising products and bullet repayments loans, this is based on the contractual repayments owed by the borrower over a 12 month or lifetime basis. This will also be adjusted for any expected overpayments made by a borrower. Early repayment/refinance assumptions are also incorporated into the calculation.
- -For revolving products, the exposure at default is predicted by taking current drawn balance and adding a "credit conversion factor" which allows for the expected drawndown of the remaining limit by the time of default. These assumptions vary by product type and current limit utilisation, based on analysis of the Group's recent default data.

The LGDs are based on the average expectation of recovery adjusted for the availability of collateral. Bank is in the process of estimating LGD based on its own recovery experience, however, till such time will continue to apply LGD as a per above approach.

Forward-looking economic information is also included in determining the 12M and lifetime PD, EAD and LGD. These assumptions vary by product type. Refer below for an explanation of forward-looking information and its inclusion in ECL calculations.

The assumptions underlying the ECL calculation - such as how the maturity profile of the PDs and how collateral values change etc. - are monitored and reviewed on a quarterly basis.

Bank evaluates the provision based on IFRS 9 methodology and minimum provisions as prescribed under Credit Risk Management Standards and incorporates the higher of the two in its assessments.

Forward-looking information incorporated in the ECL Models The assessment of SICR and the calculation of ECL both incorporate forward-looking information. The Group has performed historical analysis and identified the key economic variables impacting credit risk are oil prices and UAE equity prices.

## Credit approval

Major credit exposures to individual counterparties, groups of connected counterparties and portfolios of retail exposures are reviewed and approved by the Group's Management Credit Committee ("MCC") / Board Credit Committee ("BCC") within the authorities delegated by the Board of Directors.

## Credit rating and measurement

The risk rating system is the basis for determining the credit risk of the Group's asset portfolio (except the retail portfolio) and thus asset pricing, portfolio management, determining finance loss provisions and reserves. A grading system is being used by the Group which is based on the Group's internal estimate of probability of default, with customers or portfolios assessed against a range of quantitative and qualitative factors, including taking into account the counterparty's financial position, past experience and other factors.

## Credit monitoring

The Group regularly monitors credit exposures and external trends which may impact risk management outcomes. Internal risk management reports are presented to the Management, Board Risk Committee ("BRC") as well as to the BoD, containing information on key variables including RAS; portfolio delinquency and financing impairment performance.

All corporate accounts are monitored carefully for performance and reviewed formally on an annual basis or earlier  to  assess  any  deterioration  in  account  conduct.  The  Group  has  robust  policies  for  client  visits  and monitoring of accounts to make sure that any concerns on the quality of the accounts are addressed well in time. An exposure is categorised as watch list or non-performing as per UAE Central Bank guidelines. An early warning process is in place for regular review of accounts.

Non-performing accounts are monitored closely by the Special Assets Management Unit (SAM). Such accounts are re-evaluated and remedial actions are agreed and monitored on a periodic basis and discussed in the SAP Committee  and  BSAC.  Remedial  actions  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  exposure  reduction,  enhancement, asset search, employing litigation/recordeency, defining litigation strategy and exit of the account.

With respect to the Group's retail portfolio, asset quality is monitored closely with 30/60/90 days past due accounts and delinquency trends monitored continuously for each Retail Product of the Group. Accounts which are past due are subject to collection processes that are managed by SAM.

## Credit mitigation

Potential  credit  losses  from  any  given  account,  customer  or  portfolio  are  mitigated  using  a  range  of  tools. Additional support in the form of collateral and guarantee is obtained where required. The reliance that can be placed on these credit mitigation resources is carefully assessed in light of issues such as legal enforceability, market value and counterparty risk of the guarantor. Collateral types which are eligible for risk mitigation include: cash; residential, commercial and industrial property; fixed and movable assets such as motor vehicles, plant and machinery;  marketable  securities  and  bank  guarantees  etc.  Risk  mitigation  policies  control  the  approval  of collateral types.

Collateral is valued in accordance with the Group's risk mitigation policy, which prescribes the frequency of valuation for different collateral types to arrive at the fair values. The valuation frequency is driven by the level of price volatility of each type of collateral and the nature of the underlying product or risk exposure.

## Impaired loans and advances

Impaired loans and advances are financial assets for which the Group determines that it is probable that it will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement(s). These loans are classified as Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 (Stage 3a, 3b, and 3c applicable for Retail Portfolio), as appropriate, which is in accordance with the guidelines issued by the CBUEA.

## Past due but not impaired loans

These are loans and advances where contractual interest or principal payments are past due but the Group believes that impairment is not appropriate on the basis of a repayment source such as assigned receivables, the level of security/collateral available and/or the possible scope of collection of amounts owed to the Group. It also includes contracts where the reschedule/restructure discussions are ongoing /or has been approved but awaiting perfection of documents viz. Mortgage deed, Facility Agreement Letter (F.AL) and so on by the customer.

These are loans and advances where contractual interest or principal payments are past due but the Group believes that impairment is not appropriate on the basis of a repayment source such as assigned receivables, the level of security/collateral available and/or the possible scope of collection of amounts owed to the Group. It also includes contracts where the reschedule/restructure discussions are ongoing /or has been approved but awaiting perfection of documents viz. Mortgage deed, Facility Agreement Letter (F.AL) and so on by the customer.

## Allowances for impairment

The Group establishes allowance for impairment losses that represents its estimate for losses in its loan portfolio. The main components of this allowance are specific losses that relates to individually significant exposures and a collective impairment established for groups of homogeneous assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but have not been identified on loans that are considered individually insignificant as well as individually significant that were subject to individual assessment for impairment but not found to be individually impaired. Assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are not subject to impairment testing as the measure of fair value reflects the credit quality of each asset.

## Write-off

The Group writes off loans/securities (and any related allowances for impairment losses) when it determines that there is no scope of recovery, and the loans are uncollectible. The decision is reached after considering information such as the occurrence of significant changes in the borrower's financial position such that the borrower can no longer pay the obligation, or that proceeds from collateral will not be sufficient to pay back the entire exposure and there is no scope to pursue any other avenues, by writing down the debt to a nominal value.

## Collateral and other credit enhancements

The Group holds collateral against funded and unfunded financing facilities in the form of cash margins, pledges/liens over deposits, mortgage interests over property, other registered securities over assets and guarantees. The Group accepts guarantees mainly from well-reputed local or international banks/financial institutions, well-established local or multinational organisations, large corporates and high net worth individuals. Estimates of fair value are based on the value of collateral assessed at the time of borrowing, which are generally updated during annual reviews or earlier as the Group prides it given the circumstances and market trend /conditions. Collateral is generally not held over loans and advances to other banks or financial institutions, except when securities are held as a part of reverse repurchase and securities borrowing activity.

It is the Group's policy to ensure that loans are extended to customers within their capability to service interest and repay principal instead of relying excessively on securities/collaterals. Accordingly, depending on customers' credit worthiness and the type of product, facilities may be unsecured. Nevertheless, collateral is and can be an important credit risk mitigant.

An estimate of the fair value of collateral and other security enhancements held against loans and advances to customers is shown below. Collateral values reflect the maximum exposure or the value of the collateral whichever is lower.

## Exposure to interest rate risk

The principal risk to which non-trading portfolios are exposed is the risk of loss from fluctuations in the future cash flows or fair values of financial instruments because of changes in market interest rates. Interest risk is managed principally through monitoring interest rate gaps. A summary of the Group's interest rate gap position on non-trading portfolios is as follows:

## (c) Market risk (continued)

The assets and liabilities re-pricing profile has been determined on the basis of the final maturity period or interest re-pricing periods at the reporting date, whichever is earlier. The matching and controlled mismatching of the maturities and interest rates of assets and liabilities is fundamental to the management of the Group. It is unusual for banks to be completely matched, as transacted business is often uncertain terms and of different types. An unmatched position potentially enhances profitability, but also increases the risk of losses. The maturities of assets and liabilities and the ability to replace, at an acceptable cost, interest-bearing liabilities as they mature are important factors in assessing the liquidity of the Group and its exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.

## Sensitivity analysis - Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of asset and liability values to changes in the term structure of interest rates or interest rate volatility. Interest rate risk arises from interest bearing financial instruments and reflects the possibility that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the value of the financial instruments and related income. The Group manages the risk principally through monitoring interest rate gaps and matching the re-pricing profile of assets and liabilities. The Group also assesses the impact of defined movement in interest yield curves on its net interest income. The following is the impact of interest rate movement on net interest income and regulatory capital.

Shift in yield curve

## +200 bps.

| 2024    | 2023    |
|---------|---------|
| AED'000 | AED'000 |

The interest rate sensitivities set out above are illustrative only and employ simplified scenarios. The sensitivity does not incorporate actions that could be taken by the management to mitigate the effect of interest rate movements. Bank hedges interest rate risk through interest rate swaps as appropriate to ensure interest rate sensitivities are within risk appetite limits set forth by BO.D.

## Foreign currency risk

The Group engages in limited trading in foreign exchange on its own account. Its treasury activities are mainly directed to assisting its customers in managing their foreign exchange exposures. A system of exposure limits is in place to control price risk on foreign exchange exposures and a system of individual credit limits is in place to control counter-party risk. The amounts mentioned in the table below reflect the equal but opposite potential effect on profit and equity based on a 1% negative or positive currency fluctuation, with all other variables held constant. At the reporting date, the Group has the following net open currency exposures in respect of:

|                      | 2024  Impact on  profit or loss   | Impact on  equity   | AED'000   | AED'000   | AED'000   | 2023  Impact on  equity   | Impact on  equity   |

## 29 Risk management (continued)

## (d) Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events'. This definition includes legal and compliance risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk. Operational risks could arise from all of the Group's operations and are faced by all business entities and its enabling functions.

The Group's objective is to manage operational risk to balance the avoidance of financial losses and damage to the Group's reputation with overall cost effectiveness and innovative strategies. In all cases, Group policy requires compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

The Group has taken measures to put requisite tools in place including Operational Risk and Control Assessment (ORCA), Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA), Key Risk Indicators (KRI's) and Loss Data Collection (LDC), to identify and address all operational risk measures. The Group has also taken measures to implement directive, preventative and corrective Control measures including robust processes and policies to mitigate operational risk to an acceptable level and to avoid or minimise financial losses and damage to the Group's reputation.

## Market Conduct Risk

Market conduct is defined by CBUEA "as to how a financial institution conducts itself in the marketplace in terms of the level of integrity, fairness, and competency that it demonstrates in dealing with consumers. It includes the behavior and actions of a financial institution in the marketplace involving such matters such as, product design, development, marketing and sales practices, advertising, compliance with laws, fulfilling its obligations to customers, treatment of customer's / dispute resolution, conflicts of interest, transparency and disclosure, Market competition, pricing, etc."

The Risk exposure arising from Consumer protection regulations falls within the Operational Risk pillar under the Bank's risk management categorization. The Risk exposure from Market Conduct and its management are captured in the Bank's Conduct Risk framework.

The Bank has put in place Policy (Consumer Protection Policy &amp; Conduct Risk Framework ) to manage Market Conduct risk. As a directive Control, the policy has stipulated clear roles and responsibilities for the respective Business departments, their enabling functions and governance structures.

Compliance with Group standards is supported by a programme of periodic reviews undertaken by Internal Audit. The results of Internal Audit reviews are shared with the Board Audit &amp; Compliance Committee and senior management of the Group. The Group's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is ascertained by Internal Audit reviews, while Compliance of regulatory requirements is strengthened by the Compliance department as a Second Line of Defense function.

## (e) Information Security

Information security refers to the practices, policies and technologies to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA triad) of information at rest and in transit. Security risks that can cause damage to the CIA of Bank's information is addressed by means of meaningful, effective and business supporting controls. Ineffective technical controls have the potential to have major negative effects on finances, reputation, and regulations.

The objective of information security is to secure the banking operations by safeguard sensitive information such as customer data, financial records, intellectual property and employee records while maintaining the business continuity.

## 29 Risk management (continued)

## (e) Information Security (continued)

Information security achieves this objective through a combination of preventive, detective and corrective measures, such as but not limited to employee training, risk management, security testing, vulnerability assessment, strong governance practices, incident response practices, log monitoring, access controls, performance evaluation, defense in depth approach.

Attempt to address the risks before it materialize is supported by regulatory and compliance requirements as these are key drivers of information security efforts. Accordingly, compliance to Swift CSP, PCI DSS, UAE IAS standards are being assessed annually through regular audits.

## (f) Capital management

## Capital allocation

The Group's lead regulator, the Central Bank of the UAE, and monitors regulatory capital requirements.

The Group's objectives when managing capital are as follows:

- -Safeguarding the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and increase return for the shareholders; and
- Comply with the regulatory capital requirement set by Central Bank of the UAE.

The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The impact of the level of capital on shareholders' return is also recognised and the Group recognises the need to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with greater gearing and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.

The Group also assesses its capital requirements internally, taking into consideration growth requirements and business plans along with an assessment of all material risks faced by the Bank. Risks such as interest rate risk in the banking book, Liquidity risk, concentration risk, strategic risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk form part of the ICAAP computations.

As per the Central Bank Regulation for Basel III, the capital requirement as at 31 December 2024 is 13% (31 December 2023: 13%) inclusive of capital conservation buffer.

The Bank must comply with the following minimum requirements:

- i. CET1 must be at least 7% of risk weighted assets (RWA);
- ii. Tier 1 capital must be at least 8.5% of risk weighted assets (RWA); and
- iii. Total capital, excluding the capital conservation buffer, is calculated as sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital must be at least 10.5% of risk weighted assets (RWA).

The capital adequacy ratio is computed based on circulators issued by the CBUAE as per Basel III taking into consideration the effect of the guarantee by the Government of Sharjah.

## (g) Strategic Risk

Strategic risk refers to the risk of prospective impact on the Group's earnings, capital, reputation arising from changes in the environmental conditions or from adverse strategic decisions or its implementation.

The Group uses several factors to identify and assess the impact of strategic risk, including implementation of risk management policies and practices in the strategic planning process and its compatibility with business strategy. Strategic risks are monitored and controlled as part of the strategic planning process wherein the Group reviews the progress on strategic initiatives and considers whether the progress is in line with the plan and the external business environment. The strategic plan is periodically reviewed and updated subject to a governance process.

## 30 Taxation

On December 9, 2022, UAE Ministry of Finance (MoF) released Federal Decree Law No 47 of 2022 on the Taxation of Corporations and Businesses, Corporate Tax Law (CT Law) to enact a new CT regime in the UAE. The new CT regime has become effective for accounting periods beginning on or after June 1,2023. As the Group's accounting year ends on December 31, the first tax period will be the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, with the respective tax return to be filed on or before September 30, 2025.

Deferred taxes should be measured by reference to the tax rates and laws, as enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of the reporting period, that are expected to apply in the periods in which the assets and liabilities to which the deferred tax  relates  are  realized  or  settled.  The  Group  considered  the  application  of  IAS  12  and  any requirements for the measurement and recognition of deferred taxes for the year ended 31 December 2024. The Group has not recognised any deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year based on its latest review and assessment

The taxable income of the entities that are in scope for UAE CT purposes will be subject to the rate of 9% on taxable profits above AED 375,000.

Reconciliation of the Group's tax expense based on accounting and taxable profit is as follows:

|                                | 2024 AED'000   | 2023 AED'000   |
|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------|

| Total tax expense / (benefit)* | -              | -              |

*As the Group has incurred a loss for the year, no tax charge would apply for the current year.

## Pillar 2 Disclosure

The Group is not subject to the Pillar Two Model rules as per the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD') Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE') proposal.

## 31 Subsequent events

There are no significant events after the reporting period that would require adjustment or disclosure.
